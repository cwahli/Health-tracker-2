# AI Handover & Session Progress Board

**Updated:** 2026-08-28
**Status:** Backend Modularization Complete & Verified (All files <450KB; AI Studio 512KB corruption eliminated; 86/86 test files & 811/811 vitest tests PASS, assert-budgets PASS, assert-biomarkers PASS, tsc exit 0, full production bundle built).

- **Backend Modularization & AI Studio Corruption Fix (`server.ts`, `server_routes_r2.ts`, `server_routes_medical_gemini.ts`, `server_routes_food_analyze.ts` - 2026-08-28):**
  - **Root Cause & Diagnosis:** Forensic analysis confirmed that when Google AI Studio commits files to GitHub, its web transport splits commits into 512 KB payload buffers. When a single file exceeds 512 KB, chunk 1 (plain text 523,834 bytes) and chunk 2 (compressed deflate stream) collided on unchunking, truncating the file at byte 523,834 with binary garbage. `server.ts` had grown to 836 KB (15,550 lines), triggering this corruption repeatedly.
  - **Key Changes Applied:**
    - **`server_routes_r2.ts` (22 KB / 634 lines):** Extracted Cloudflare R2 S3 photo uploading, log migration, streaming proxies, and signed URL generation into a standalone router.
    - **`server_routes_medical_gemini.ts` (210 KB / 3,805 lines):** Extracted all Gemini medical/diagnostic routes (`/api/gemini/medical-analyze`, `/api/gemini/review-biomarker`, `/api/gemini/health-baseline-analyze`, `/api/gemini/insight-analyze`, etc.) into a dedicated Express router.
    - **`server_routes_food_analyze.ts` (430 KB / 7,774 lines):** Extracted the monolithic `/api/gemini/food-analyze` and `/api/gemini/front-desk` vision scout/dietitian analysis pipelines into a dedicated Express router.
    - **Clean Top-Level Architecture (`server.ts` - 160 KB / 3,548 lines):** Unnested routes and utilities from inside `async function startServer()`, making all shared LLM dispatchers and schema validators top-level module exports. Sunk frontend Vite/static middleware into `startServer()` right before `app.listen()`, preventing top-level await errors in CJS bundling.
    - **Guaranteed Sub-450KB File Threshold:** Every single file across the entire repository is now strictly under 450 KB (well below the 512 KB boundary), permanently safeguarding AI Studio workflows against web buffer truncations.
  - **Verification:** `npx tsc --noEmit` exit 0 (zero errors); `npx vitest run` 86/86 test files and 811/811 tests PASS; `node scripts/assert-budgets.mjs` PASS; `node scripts/assert-biomarker-ingest.mjs` & `assert-biomarker-lifecycle-m31.mjs` PASS; `npm run build` production client + CJS backend bundle built cleanly.
  - **Root Cause & Diagnosis:** When a composite dish contained subcomponents (e.g. Broccoli), the backend assigned a mathematically derived `compIndex = (si * 100) + (cIdx + 1)`. For the first subcomponent of the first dish, this yielded `1`. However, top-level sibling items (like Rolled Oats) were sequentially indexed `0, 1, 2...`. This caused a strict mathematical collision where a child component (Broccoli) and a top-level sibling (Rolled Oats) both shared `scoutIndex = 1`. In `PortionClarifyCard.tsx`, since React state keys were driven by `scoutIndex`, clicking the "Custom (g)" button for one inherently fired the state transition for both simultaneously.
  - **Key Changes Applied:** 
    - Offset all dynamically generated subcomponent `compIndex` values by an isolated absolute baseline of `10000` (e.g., `10000 + (si * 100) + cIdx`).
    - This mathematically guarantees that parent `scoutIndex` tracking (0-999) will never collide with deep subcomponent tracking arrays, safely breaking the cross-wiring of their React form states.
  - **Verification:** Run `npx vitest run server_portion_clarify.test.ts` PASS, `node scripts/assert-budgets.mjs` PASS, `npx tsc --noEmit` exits 0.

- **Subcomponent OCR Propagation & Composite Summation Fixed (`server_dish_finalize.ts` - 2026-08-27):**
  - **Root Cause & Diagnosis:**
    1. *Ignored Child OCR Labels*: The backend's `finalizeDishLedger` only checked for `rawNutritionLabel` on the parent `item`, meaning when the user scanned an OCR label for the "Rolled Oats" child component, it was completely ignored by the backend engine (defaulting back to the LLM's weak estimate).
    2. *Parent-Child Macro Decoupling*: For composite dishes, the parent dish's `nutrients` totals were independently derived from the AI's top-level estimate (scaled by R). It never physically summed the underlying child components. Thus, the parent displayed 191 kcal while the children were entirely different.
  - **Key Changes Applied:**
    - **Global OCR Extractor:** Extracted OCR parsing into a generic `parseOcrLabel` helper function.
    - **Child OCR Interception:** Modified the `componentsDetailList` mapping pipeline to intercept `c.rawNutritionLabel` on individual ingredients, enforcing the OCR truth at the subcomponent level.
    - **Bottom-Up Summation Enforcement:** Added a final aggregation block for composite dishes. If a dish has granular components, the parent's macros are now forcibly overwritten by the exact sum of its children's macros, guaranteeing mathematical integrity in the UI ledger.
  - **Verification & Gates:** Run `npx vitest run server_dish_finalize.test.ts` PASS, `npx tsc --noEmit` exit 0, `node scripts/assert-budgets.mjs` PASS exit 0.

- **Subcomponent Portion Cascading & Brand-Lock Override Fixes (`server_portion_clarify.ts`, `server_dish_finalize.ts` - 2026-08-27):**
  - **Root Cause & Diagnosis:**
    1. *Unsynced Component Lists*: When the Rolled Oats portion was updated to 70g during portion clarification, `applyPortionChoices` successfully updated the `components` list but missed updating the parallel `componentsDetailList`. Consequently, downstream processors still saw the old 40g weight.
    2. *Inappropriate Brand Overrides*: A generic, crowdsourced brand match (30g serving of "Rolled Oats" for 120 kcal) triggered on the parent dish name "Boiled Rolled Oats with Water". This forcibly overwrote the composite sum of ingredients with a scaled version of the brand entry (120 kcal * 1.15 = 138 kcal), completely negating the user's explicit portion choice.
    3. *Fixed Macro Density Scaling*: The child subcomponent weights were adjusted, but their absolute macro values (`calories`, `protein`, etc.) were retained instead of being proportionally scaled. This caused the UI to show an artificially lowered density metric.
  - **Key Changes Applied:**
    - **Subcomponent Sync (`server_portion_clarify.ts`):** Added logic in `applyPortionChoices` to synchronize updates to `componentsDetailList` so that the downstream pipeline inherits the exact user-clarified ingredient weights.
    - **Composite Brand Override Bypass (`server_dish_finalize.ts`):** Added a structural safeguard to `matchBrandMenu` execution; the engine will now bypass generic brand lookups for parent composite dishes that possess child ingredients (unless explicitly tagged with a fast-food chain). This guarantees that the dish calorie total relies precisely on the sum of its constituent components.
    - **Dynamic Macro Scaling (`server_dish_finalize.ts`):** Modified the child structuring block in `finalizeDishLedger` to physically scale the raw `calories`, `protein`, and `totalFat` absolute totals based on `cWeight / cBasisWeight` (i.e. `70g / 40g`). This perfectly preserves the ingredient's nutritional density throughout the cascade.
  - **Verification & Gates:** Run `npx vitest run server_dish_finalize.test.ts` PASS, run `npx vitest run server_portion_clarify.test.ts` PASS, `npx tsc --noEmit` exit 0, `node scripts/assert-budgets.mjs` PASS exit 0.

- **Composite Deep-Fried Fat Rebalance & Auth Pre-warm (`server_vision_scout.ts`, `agents/scoutInstructions.ts`, `src/components/LogChat.tsx` - 2026-08-27):**
  - **Root Cause & Diagnosis:**
    1. *Underestimated Deep-Fried Fat & Parent-Child Discrepancy*: While the Vision Scout recognized the fast-food fried chicken meal as `deep_fried` and emitted a realistic 28g of fat at the composite parent level (`dishNutrients`), it often missed specifying the fat macros at the child ingredient level (Crispy Fried Chicken, French Fries). Because of this, the `parseAndHealVisionScout` function defaulted the child ingredients to low-fat generic estimates. This caused the sum of the child ingredients (10.5g fat, 495 kcal) to fall drastically short of the parent ledger record (28g fat, 652 kcal), and resulted in underestimated metrics when displaying the breakdown.
    2. *Missed Commercial Baseline*: The Vision Scout prompt didn't explicitly instruct the model to look at OCR branding, so it used home-cooked baselines rather than matching fast-food commercial norms.
    3. *Auth Timeout & Write Drop*: Firebase Auth initialization timed out on fast meal submissions because the token wasn't fresh, forcing an unauthenticated local-storage fallback while the `POST /Firestore/Write/channel` request was dropped.
  - **Key Changes Applied:**
    - **Parent-Child Fat Reconciliation (`server_vision_scout.ts`):** Implemented an invariant in `parseAndHealVisionScout` that compares the parent dish `totalFat` to the sum of the child ingredients' `totalFat`. If the parent fat exceeds the sum (representing absorbed cooking oil / deep-frying), the delta is distributed proportionally (by weight) to the child ingredients, and their calories are recalculated.
    - **OCR Brand Anchoring (`agents/scoutInstructions.ts`):** Updated the scout prompt's `baseInstruction` to explicitly direct the model to read OCR text on cups and wrappers to anchor nutritional estimates against standard commercial fast-food nutrition tables.
    - **Auth Token Pre-warming (`src/components/LogChat.tsx`):** Added silent, background calls to `auth.currentUser?.getIdToken(true).catch(() => {})` in `handleImageSelect` and `handleSend` to guarantee a fresh auth token is ready before the heavy meal submission is fired off, preventing slow-connection fallbacks.
  - **Verification & Gates:** Run `npx vitest run server_vision_scout.test.ts` PASS, all 811 tests PASS, `npx tsc --noEmit` exit 0, `node scripts/assert-budgets.mjs` PASS exit 0.

- **Biomarker Diagnostic Review & Calibration Agent Harmonization (`agents/biomarkerInstructions.ts`, `server.ts`, `src/utils/biomarkers.ts`, `src/utils/biomarkerIdentity.test.ts` - 2026-08-27):**
  - **Root Cause & Diagnosis:**
    1. *False "Critical" Alarm on Chronic Biomarkers*: In `biomarkerDefinitions`, chronic metabolic markers (LDL-C, eGFR, hs-CRP, Vitamin D, HbA1c, ApoB, Triglycerides) had conditions hardcoded with `alias: 'Critical', severity: 'critical'`, and fallback heuristics branded anything >1.3x normal as `"critical"`. For an LDL of 4.3 mmol/L (normal < 2.6), this displayed a panic "CRITICAL" badge despite LDL 4.3 being elevated cardiovascular risk, not an acute emergency room crisis.
    2. *Pipeline Disconnect for Diagnostic Review Agent*: `agents/biomarkerInstructions.ts` was a 1-line stub; `server.ts` had an inline prompt copy instead of importing from `agents/`; and the Gemini `responseSchema` for `proposal` lacked `rangeBrackets` and `keyName`, blocking Gemini Flash Lite in constrained decoding mode from emitting demographic-calibrated clinical bracket arrays.
  - **Key Changes Applied:**
    - **Unified Clinical Prompt (`agents/biomarkerInstructions.ts`):** Implemented the structured YAML prompt enforcing the standard clinical $-5$ to $+5$ integer severity scale ($0$ = Optimal, $+1\dots+4$ = Progressive Elevation, $-1\dots-4$ = Progressive Deficiency, $\pm 5$ = Acute Panic Emergency only), forbidding the word "Critical" for non-emergency chronic markers, and prioritizing demographic/ethnicity-specific guidelines.
    - **Single Source of Truth & Constrained Schema Upgrade (`server.ts`):** Imported `biomarkerReviewSystemInstruction` into `server.ts` directly from `agents/biomarkerInstructions`, and updated `responseSchema` to include `keyName` and `rangeBrackets` with integer `severity` and numeric `min`/`max`.
    - **Catalog Clinical Labels & Numeric Severity (`src/utils/biomarkers.ts`):** Replaced non-emergency `'Critical'` aliases across built-in definitions with established clinical terms (`'Very High'`, `'Decreased (CKD G3)'`, `'High risk'`, `'Severe deficiency'`) and integer severities ($4$ and $-4$).
    - **Dynamic Agent Clinical Label Priority (`src/utils/biomarkers.ts`):** Updated `getCustomStatusLabel` to prioritize the agent's calibrated `rangeBrackets` clinical labels FIRST over generic catalog definitions. Aligned `getBiomarkerStatus` and `evaluateStructuredRange` so that only severities $\le -5$ or $\ge +5$ return `'critical'`, values with deficiency severities ($-1\dots-4$) or low keywords return `'low'`, and elevated severities ($+1\dots+4$) return `'high'`. Extended `getBiomarkerColor` and `getBiomarkerStatusLabel` to properly color and display clinical labels across `HomeTab` and `MedicalHistoryTab`.
  - **Verification & Gates:** All 120 biomarker tests in `vitest` PASS, `node scripts/assert-budgets.mjs` PASS exit 0, `node scripts/assert-biomarker-ingest.mjs` and `node scripts/assert-biomarker-lifecycle-m31.mjs` PASS exit 0, `npx tsc --noEmit` exit 0 (zero type errors), `npm run build` production bundle built cleanly in 17.5s.

- **Composite Dish Sub-Ingredient Weight & Title Component Completeness (`NutritionLabelTable.tsx`, `server_dish_finalize.ts`, `server_vision_scout.ts`, `server.ts` - 2026-08-27):**
  - **Root Cause & Diagnosis:**
    1. *0g Sub-Ingredient Weights*: In `NutritionLabelTable.tsx`, `sibWeight` evaluated `sib.weightGrams || sib.estimatedWeightGrams || 0`. When sub-components in composite dishes arrived from the vision scout or budget ledger under alternative keys (or without pre-scaled gram weights), the breakdown rows rendered `(0g)` and failed to calculate proportional sub-component calories and macronutrients.
    2. *Incomplete Dish Titles & Missing Visual Components*: When dishes contained multiple ingredients (e.g. broccoli, baby corn, chicken egg), the dish name and footer lists only captured the primary base name if the Scout or Dietitian emitted a truncated label, and `server.ts` `itemsBreakdown` mapping dropped `componentsDetailList`/`compositeSiblings` when transferring from `preCalculatedItems` and `preMatch`.
  - **Key Changes Applied:**
    - **End-to-End Component Preservation in Backend Ledger (`server_dish_finalize.ts` & `server_vision_scout.ts`):** Populated `componentsDetailList`, `compositeSiblings`, `hasComponents`, and `ingredientsList` in `finalizeDishLedger`, `clusterSpatialCompositeDishes`, and `parsedScout.dishes` processing, ensuring every constituent item retains its exact physical weight and nutrient profile.
    - **Comprehensive Dish Title Assembly:** When multiple constituent components are identified in a single dish, the dish title automatically incorporates all constituent ingredients (e.g. *"Broccoli with Baby Corn, Chicken Egg"*), and `visualIngredients` / `ingredientsList` are completely populated.
    - **Reconciliation & Dietitian Context Enrichment (`server.ts`):** Propagated `componentsDetailList` and `compositeSiblings` through `preCalculatedItems`, `preCalculatedCtx` (providing the Dietitian LLM with full breakdown transparency), and final `itemsBreakdown` reconstruction.
    - **Robust Frontend Rendering & Fallback Math (`NutritionLabelTable.tsx`):** Enhanced `sibWeight` computation to check `weightGrams`, `estimatedWeightGrams`, `weight`, and volumetric percentages, and added comprehensive fallback macro calculations (`calories`, `protein`, `totalFat`, `carbohydrates`) directly from the constituent component records.
  - **Verification & Gates:** 86/86 vitest test files (800/800 tests) passing, `node scripts/assert-budgets.mjs` PASS exit 0, `node scripts/assert-agent-governance.mjs` PASS exit 0, `node scripts/assert-biomarker-lifecycle-m31.mjs` PASS exit 0, `npx tsc --noEmit` exit 0.

- **Nutrient Table Sorting Fix & Live Run Diagnostic Review (`NutritionLabelTable.tsx`, `nutrition.ts` - 2026-08-26):**
  - **Root Cause & Diagnosis:**
    1. *Sodium Shown Before Carbs & Protein*: In `STANDARD_NUTRIENT_ORDER` and `nutrientDefinitions`, `sodium` had priority index 40, placing it before `carbohydrates` (50) and `protein` (70). On the live site screenshot, the user saw Calories $\to$ Fat $\to$ Sodium $\to$ Carbs $\to$ Protein, violating the requested pattern where Sodium is placed after protein and core macros.
    2. *Grocery Weight Overestimation in Composite Hotpot*: In job `job_1787777163584_4sj1lom3l`, Gemini detected 100% of visible packages (both beef trays, raw egg, baby corn, enoki, and broccoli), but assigned the entire raw gross pack weight `440g` to broccoli (instead of ~200-250g trimmed edible florets). This pushed hotpot calories to 715 kcal (total meal 835 kcal), though all 6 ingredients and multi-dish separation functioned accurately.
  - **Key Changes Applied:**
    - **Reordered `STANDARD_NUTRIENT_ORDER` & `nutrientDefinitions`:** Moved Sodium and Salt to order index 60 (strictly after Carbohydrates [30] and Protein [50]), ensuring tables display: 1. Calories $\to$ 2. Total Fat $\to$ 3. Carbohydrates (Fiber, Sugars) $\to$ 4. Protein $\to$ 5. Sodium/Salt $\to$ 6. Vitamins & Minerals.
    - **Rebuilt & Restarted Live Server:** Built production bundle (`npm run build` exit 0) and restarted daemon server on port 3000.
  - **Verification & Gates:** `node scripts/assert-budgets.mjs` PASS exit 0, `npx tsc --noEmit` exit 0, all 54 test files (466/466 tests) in `src/` PASS.

- **AI Studio Biomarker Pull & Interactive UI Portion Size Controller (`FoodCard.tsx`, `NutritionLabelTable.tsx`, `FoodHistoryTab.tsx`, `types.ts`, `biomarkers.ts`, `MedicalHistoryTab.tsx`, `App.tsx` - 2026-08-26):**
  - **Root Cause & Diagnosis:**
    1. *Biomarker Upgrades from AI Studio*: Needed integration of latest hematocrit `L/L` reference ranges (`0.36 - 0.50`), hemoglobin range `120 - 175`, profile-adjusted range prioritization, and structured range severity brackets in `App.tsx` and `MedicalHistoryTab.tsx`.
    2. *Portion Sizing & Visual Scaling Transparency*: Users required clear transparency when visual portions are scaled and the ability to accept or adjust portions in 0ms directly on the card, with portion sizes clearly indicated next to weights in the expanded dish breakdown.
  - **Key Changes Applied:**
    - **Integrated Latest AI Studio Biomarker Upgrades:** Pulled clean biomarker updates into `src/utils/biomarkers.ts`, `src/components/MedicalHistoryTab.tsx`, and `src/App.tsx`.
    - **Portion Size Note & Acceptance Controller:** Added an interactive portion banner below the Meal Composition thumbnails in `FoodCard.tsx` displaying `⚖️ Portion size applied: {portionScale}x (Visual Estimate)` with instant `[ 0.5x ] [ 1.0x ] [ 1.5x ] [ 2.0x ]` chips and a `✓ Accept` button to scale nutrition in 0ms without extra LLM latency.
    - **Expanded Dish Breakdown Portion Indicators:** Updated `NutritionLabelTable.tsx` and `FoodCard.tsx`'s item breakdown table to display portion sizes next to item weights (e.g. `250g (1.0x)` or `60g (7.5% of 795g pack)`).
    - **History Tab Sync:** Added the portion size indicator to `FoodHistoryTab.tsx` below the meal composition.
    - **Extended Types:** Added `packGrams`, `portionRatio`, `portionAccepted`, `portionDescription` to `FoodLog` and `FoodItemBreakdown` in `src/types.ts`.
  - **Verification & Gates:** 54/54 test files (466/466 tests) in `src/` passing exit 0, `tsc --noEmit` exit 0.

- **Hierarchical Scout Schema Optimization & 10-Case Benchmark (`scout_hierarchical_instructions.ts`, `backend_nutrient_calculator.ts`, `Image_nutrients_true_value.md` - 2026-08-26):**
  - **Root Cause & Diagnosis:** Legacy vision prompts contained redundant enum listings, duplicate nutrient instructions, and ambiguous scaling rules, causing token bloat (~460 words) and lack of explicit transparency on when multi-serving retail packages were scaled down into single-portion prepared meals.
  - **Key Changes Applied:**
    - **Ultra-Lean System Prompt & Direct Schema Enums:** Condensed the system instruction to ~75 words by placing `contentType`, `diningEnvironment`, and `cookingMethod` enums directly in the schema and JSON example.
    - **Compact Scaling Variables (`weightGrams` & `packGrams`):** Shortened weight identifiers to save >50% token cost, with `packGrams` (nullable) capturing retail container size (e.g. 800g oats bag, 440g broccoli pack) and `weightGrams` capturing the consumed portion in the dish.
    - **Exhaustive 10-Case Benchmark Verification:** Audited all 10 image sets across 31 nutrients in `Image_nutrients_true_value.md`. Achieved an average calorie accuracy of ~10.5% across all 10 cases (e.g. 0.0% on Case 10 Barcoded Hotpot, -5% on Case 04 Parfait/Pastries/Salad, -9% on Case 08 Oats Porridge).
    - **Zero-Latency User Confirmation:** Verified that 1-tap dish portion confirmation (e.g. confirming whole cooked hotpot batch vs single bowl) instantly reduces composite meal delta from -34% to -2.9% in 0ms without extra LLM calls.
  - **Verification & Gates:** Benchmark test suites (`test_cases_1_to_3.ts`, `test_cases_4_to_10.ts`, `test_4_images.ts`) passing exit 0 with high precision.

- **Biomarker Effective Risk & Cosmetic Tag Alignment (`biomarkers.ts`, `MedicalHistoryTab.tsx`, `biomarkerIdentity.test.ts` - 2026-08-26):**
  - **Root Cause & Diagnosis:** A visual discrepancy existed where a biomarker category header (e.g. "Cholesterol") showed "CRITICAL RISK" (computed via strict numeric formula) while the triggering individual biomarker row showed "At risk" (computed via customized tag/label logic). The UI severity computation `getSeverityScore` did not align with the custom string labels evaluated by `getBiomarkerStatusLabel` and `getBiomarkerRiskTag`.
  - **Key Changes Applied:**
    - **Unified Risk Evaluator:** Introduced `getBiomarkerEffectiveRisk` in `biomarkers.ts` which evaluates both the underlying numeric severity score (1-4) and the rendered cosmetic string tag, ensuring the mathematical severity is tightly coupled to the cosmetic outcome (e.g., if the tag evaluates to "At risk", the score mathematically defaults to 3; "Critical" to 4; "Normal" to 2).
    - **UI Aggregation Harmonization:** Updated `MedicalHistoryTab.tsx` to use `getBiomarkerEffectiveRisk` for computing category header statuses (`highestRisk.tag`, `highestRisk.bg`), completely eliminating divergent calculations.
    - **Verification & Gates:** 85/85 vitest files (793/793 tests) passing, `tsc --noEmit` exit 0, full production compilation succeeded.

- **Biomarker Diagnostic UI Streamlining & Category Harmonization (`BiomarkerAuditModal.tsx`, `BiomarkerDictionaryModal.tsx`, `biomarkers.ts`, `MedicalHistoryTab.tsx` - 2026-08-26):**
  - **Root Cause & Diagnosis:**
    1. *Diagnostic Modal Header*: Contained legacy verbose text ("Biomarker Health & Quality Audit", "Full Suite Diagnostic", "• Automatic Proposals & Agent Support", "Audited") that added UI clutter.
    2. *Missing Category Discrepancy*: Standard clinical score definitions (e.g. `hemorrhoidal_symptom_score`, `gerd_symptom_score`, `joint_pain_severity_score`, `audit_c_total_score`, `qrisk2`, `audit_score`, `weekly_alcohol_consumption`) were configured with `standardMedicalGrouping: 'Other'`, which caused `isMissingCategory` in `MedicalHistoryTab.tsx` to flag them with `"Missing Category (To Be Approved)"` even though they were catalog built-ins and did not appear in the Dictionary's approval queue.
  - **Key Changes Applied:**
    - **Streamlined Diagnostic Modal UI:** Updated the header title in `BiomarkerAuditModal.tsx` to `"Biomarker diagnostic"` and removed the badges/subtitles (`"Full Suite Diagnostic"`, `"• Automatic Proposals & Agent Support"`, `"Audited"`), rendering a clean counter: `<strong className="text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-200">{report.totalScanned}</strong> custom biomarkers`.
    - **Clinical Scoring Groupings Harmonization:** Updated `standardMedicalGrouping` for clinical scores to their appropriate medical practices (`'Gastrointestinal'`, `'Musculoskeletal'`, `'Cardiovascular'`, `'Screenings & Assessments'`).
    - **Shared Category Validation Helper:** Added `isBiomarkerMissingCategory` in `src/utils/biomarkers.ts` and wired it to `MedicalHistoryTab.tsx`, ensuring approved built-in biomarkers are never falsely marked as missing category or pending approval.
    - **Verification & Gates:** 85/85 vitest files (793/793 tests) passing, `tsc --noEmit` exit 0, full production compilation succeeded.

- **Hallucinated Data Cleanup & Robust Sync Stabilization (`dataSanitize.ts`, `biomarkers.ts`, `syncUtils.ts`, `server_routes_sync.ts`, `storageUtils.ts`, `App.tsx` - 2026-08-26):**
  - **Root Cause & Diagnosis:** Discrepancies between authentic NHS/EMIS lab reports and app records originated from four distinct vectors:
    1. *Synthetic Panels*: Artificially generated panels (e.g. 16-08-2026 synthetic metabolic panel with `estimated_average_glucose`) entered the dataset via chat agent simulations and fallback date defaulting (`new Date().toISOString()`) when dates were omitted.
    2. *Auto-BMI Phantom History Generator*: A reactive `useEffect` in `App.tsx` created daily history entries with `"Auto-logged default BMI: 70 kg, 175 cm."`, polluting history logs with artificial single-marker entries.
    3. *Clinical Note Contamination*: Wearable sync (`handleGoogleStepsUpdated`) appended `" | Auto-synced from Google Fit"` across all biomarkers on the same date, clobbering authentic lab notes.
    4. *Sync Overwrite & Data Collision*: Hardcoded profile fallbacks (`weight: 70`, `height: 175`, `age: 28`) in `server_routes_sync.ts` and `storageUtils.ts` clobbered real user profiles, while Supabase realtime syncing used naive `mergeByRecency` instead of `mergeBiomarkerHistory`.
  - **Key Changes Applied:**
    - **Hallucinated Data Purge:** Added `purgeHallucinatedAndCorruptedData` in `dataSanitize.ts`, automatically removing synthetic 16-08-2026 panels, dropping phantom auto-BMI logs, and stripping contaminated Google Fit notes from clinical records while recording deleted IDs to prevent cloud resurrection.
    - **Eliminated Phantom Auto-Logging & Date Defaulting:** Removed the auto-BMI history generation `useEffect` in `App.tsx` and prevented the clinical data parser from falling back to `today` when lab dates are missing.
    - **Sanitized Mathematical Conversions:** Removed synthetic substitutions (hardcoded 143 sodium, dividing lymphocytes by 6) in `normalizeHistoricalTelemetryErrors` in `biomarkers.ts`.
    - **Sync Resiliency & Profile Preservation:** Updated `mergeBiomarkerHistory` in `syncUtils.ts` to preserve non-conflicting wearable steps and clinical notes across same-day logs. Removed hardcoded profile overrides in `server_routes_sync.ts` and `storageUtils.ts` to protect authentic user demographic data.
    - **Verification & Gates:** 84/84 vitest test files (775/775 tests) passing, `tsc --noEmit` exit 0, all master assertion gates passing (`assert-biomarker-lifecycle-m31.m31`, `assert-biomarker-flow.mjs`).

- **Edit Mode Quality & Diagnostics Refinements (`server.ts`, `agents/dietitianInstructions.ts`, `server_dish_finalize.ts` - 2026-08-25):**
  - **Narrative Edit Confirmation:** Updated `buildModeAEditInstruction` so Beat 1 of the Dietitian narrative explicitly confirms the user's specific edit (e.g. *"Updated your iced tea to unsweetened, removing 18g of added sugar"*) before delivering clinical balance coaching.
  - **Descriptive Dish Name Preservation:** Updated `origItemSameFood` in `server.ts` to preserve descriptive dish titles (e.g. `"Sizzling Steak with Wedges and Vegetables"`) during edit merges rather than allowing them to be downgraded to generic keywords (`"steak meal"`).
  - **Dining Environment Inheritance:** Ensured `diningEnvironment` is inherited from `activeMeal.diningEnvironment` across edit turns, preventing fallback to `"unknown"`.
  - **Complete Micronutrient Backfilling:** Integrated `backfillSparseMicronutrients` into `finalizeDishLedger` in `server_dish_finalize.ts` so all 33 nutrient columns have complete trace mineral and vitamin estimates.
  - **Verification & Gates:** 81/81 vitest files (764/764 tests) passing, `tsc --noEmit` exit 0, all 5 master assertion gates passing (`assert-budgets.mjs`, `assert-biomarker-lifecycle-m31.mjs`, `assert-biomarker-ingest.mjs`, `assert-agent-governance.mjs`).

- **Edit Mode Continuity & Full Nutrient Aggregation Re-evaluation (`server.ts`, `server_nutrient_aggregation.ts`, `server_dietitian_adjustment.test.ts` - 2026-08-25):**
  - **Problem & Root Cause:** In text-only edit mode (`!hasImages && activeMeal`), `visionScoutItems` and `preCalculatedItems` were empty because no new scout ran, causing `server.ts` to fall through to the legacy multi-component aggregator where `isAlreadyPrepared` was hardcoded to `false`. This re-added phantom frying/cooking oils across all items ($55\text{g fat} \to 94.4\text{g fat}$, $1,363\text{ kcal} \to 1,718\text{ kcal}$). Furthermore, when users specified `"unsweetened"`, the LLM reasoned about it but omitted numerical overrides in its JSON, leaving the iced tea at 72 kcal.
  - **Edit State Continuity & Pre-Calculated Injection:** Added automatic backfill of `visionScoutItems` from `activeMeal.itemsBreakdown` in `server.ts` during edit sessions, running `finalizeDishLedger` to establish `preCalculatedItems`.
  - **Linguistic Delta Overrides in Pure TS:** Added pure TypeScript delta checks on `message` (e.g. `unsweetened`, `no sugar`, `sugar free`, `tanpa gula`) to immediately zero out `sugar`, `addedSugar`, `carbohydrates`, and `calories` on beverage items and lock them.
  - **Full Nutrient Aggregation with Prepared Dish Immunity:** Fixed `isAlreadyPrepared` in `server_nutrient_aggregation.ts` to evaluate `checkIfItemIsAlreadyPrepared` and `isDishEstimate`, allowing the full 33-nutrient aggregator to re-run and cascade all macro/micro shifts without adding synthetic cooking oil to prepared dishes.
  - **Verification & Gates:** 80/80 vitest files (759/759 tests) passing, `tsc --noEmit` exit 0, all 5 master assertion gates passing (`assert-budgets.mjs`, `assert-biomarker-lifecycle-m31.mjs`, `assert-biomarker-ingest.mjs`, `assert-agent-governance.mjs`).

- **Universal Container Volumetric Conservation & Two-Phase Sauce/Solid Decomposition Engine (`server_dish_classify.ts`, `server_derivation.ts`, `server_dish_finalize.ts`, `server_vision_scout.ts` - 2026-08-25):**
  - **Problem & Root Cause:** 2D single-angle food photography causes camera scale distortion and depth ambiguity, leading models to overestimate total platter mass (e.g. estimating 480g of food on a 20cm skillet with a physical capacity of only 320g). Additionally, sauced entrees (e.g. sizzling steak in black pepper sauce, chicken in curry) lacked two-phase decomposition, causing liquid gravies/sauces to be evaluated as solid meat and inflating estimated protein.
  - **Container Volumetric Conservation:** Added `ContainerForm` classification and `reconcileContainerVolumeBudget` in `server_dish_classify.ts` with geometric volume budgets (e.g. `sizzling_skillet` $\le 320\text{g}$, `side_bowl` $\le 220\text{g}$, `entree_plate` $\le 650\text{g}$). Co-located items sharing a constrained container are automatically normalized down proportionally to the container's physical displacement limit without altering their relative proportions.
  - **Two-Phase Sauce/Solid Decomposition:** Implemented `decomposeSaucedEntree` in `server_derivation.ts` and wired it into `finalizeDishLedger` in `server_dish_finalize.ts`. Separates solid protein ($\approx 60\%$) from liquid sauce glaze ($\approx 40\%$) and bounds maximum possible protein to the biological meat muscle capacity ($\le 24\text{–}26\text{g protein} / 100\text{g solid meat}$), preventing sauces from acting as phantom protein.
  - **Verification & Gates:** 80/80 vitest files (758/758 tests) passing, `tsc --noEmit` exit 0, all 5 master assertion gates passing (`assert-budgets.mjs`, `assert-biomarker-lifecycle-m31.mjs`, `assert-biomarker-ingest.mjs`, `assert-agent-governance.mjs`).

- **Bottom-Up Calorie Derivation & Dietitian Clinical Audit Engine (`server_derivation.ts`, `server_dish_finalize.ts`, `server_vision_scout.ts`, `agents/dietitianInstructions.ts`, `server.ts`, `TaskPlaceholderCard.tsx` - 2026-08-25):**
  - **Problem & Root Cause:** Top-down calorie estimation in the Vision Scout caused severe phantom carbohydrate inflation (40–80g carbs overcounted per savory meal) and calorie hallucinations (up to +615 kcal) because carbohydrates were back-solved as an Atwater residual $((\text{Calories} - 4\text{P} - 9\text{F})/4)$. Furthermore, passive "accept by default" instructions and composite dish locks in `LedgerInvariant` suppressed valid clinical dietitian adjustments. Additionally, UI pill badges rendered `'Calculating...'` when raw calories were omitted from scout payloads, and naive comma splitting on parenthetical lists caused 3x scale inflation ($R = 3.0$) on spatial re-clustering.
  - **Bottom-Up Thermodynamic Calorie Pipeline ($4\text{P} + 4\text{C} + 9\text{F}$):** Updated Vision Scout to predict physical `carbohydrates` directly based on visible starch mass (potatoes, rice, noodles, bread, batter) and sugar liquids without guessing abstract calories. Built `computeCaloriesFromMacros` in `server_derivation.ts` and updated `finalizeDishLedger` in `server_dish_finalize.ts` to compute Calories bottom-up deterministically while preserving authentic OCR label and Brand Menu locks.
  - **Parenthetical Comma Protection & Spatial Cluster Basis Re-anchoring:** Updated `parseAndHealVisionScout` to ignore commas within parentheses (e.g. `"Mixed Vegetables (Corn, Peas, Carrots)"`) and preserve items with direct nutrient estimates intact. Updated `clusterSpatialCompositeDishes` to re-anchor `nutrientBasisWeight = totalWeight` and sum nutrients across clustered items, guaranteeing $R = 1.0$ and eliminating the 3x macro inflation.
  - **Multi-Photo Weight & Macro Combination:** Updated multi-photo deduplication in `server_vision_scout.ts` so that when duplicate visual companion dishes appear across multiple plates without printed labels, their portion weights and nutrients are combined ($100\text{g} + 90\text{g} = 190\text{g}$) rather than dropping companion plates.
  - **UI Item Badge Instant Derivation:** Added bottom-up macro calorie fallback ($4\text{P} + 4\text{C} + 9\text{F}$) in `TaskPlaceholderCard.tsx` so scout item badges immediately render exact calories (e.g. `276 kcal`, `204 kcal`) instead of falling back to `'Calculating...'`.
  - **Cross-Photo Asymmetric Overlap Safeguard:** Updated `overlapRatio` denominator in `server_vision_scout.ts` from `Math.min` to `Math.max(tokensA.length, tokensB.length)` to prevent subset companion sides across multi-plate photos from being falsely collapsed ($2/5 = 40\% < 75\%$).
  - **Active Dietitian Clinical Audit & Pure TS Macro Rebalancing:** Replaced passive "accept by default" prompt phrasing in `agents/dietitianInstructions.ts` and `server.ts` with active clinical audit instructions under strict L12 net-zero prompt budget. Built `rebalanceNutrientProfile` in `server_derivation.ts` so that whenever the Dietitian updates one or more nutrients (e.g. adjusts fat for oil absorption or sodium for fast-food seasoning), dependent metrics ($\text{Calories} = 4\text{P} + 4\text{C} + 9\text{F}$, $\text{Unsaturated Fat}$, $\text{Salt}$, and physical density bounds) are recalculated deterministically.
  - **Composite Dish Correction Preservation:** Updated `truthNutrients: { ...(preMatch.truthNutrients || {}), ...n }` in `server.ts` line 8888, ensuring that clinical dietitian adjustments flow through composite dish ledgers rather than being overwritten by sub-component row sums.
  - **Verification & Gates:** 80/80 vitest files (754/754 tests) passing, `tsc --noEmit` exit 0, all 5 master assertion gates passing (`assert-budgets.mjs`, `assert-biomarker-lifecycle-m31.mjs`, `assert-biomarker-ingest.mjs`, `assert-agent-governance.mjs`).

- **Multi-Device Ready / Inbox Meal Synchronization (`SupabaseJobSync.ts`, `JobStore.ts`, `App.tsx` - 2026-08-25):**
  - **Design & Architecture:** Enabled end-to-end multi-device synchronization for pending, in-progress, and completed meal analyses (Ready / Inbox queue) across mobile, desktop, and AI Studio environments.
  - **Multi-Tier Cloud Upsert & Hydration:** Updated `upsertJobToSupabase` in `src/jobs/SupabaseJobSync.ts` with a 3-layer resilient pipeline: primary `/api/jobs/upsert` endpoint $\to$ direct Supabase client (`agent_jobs`) $\to$ Firebase Firestore mirror (`users/{uid}/inbox_jobs/{jobId}`), ensuring mobile web apps and remote preview frames reliably broadcast draft jobs to cloud storage.
  - **Direct Hydration on Manual Sync:** Updated `hydrateUserJobs` to fallback to direct Supabase queries and Firestore `inbox_jobs` when relative `/api/jobs/status` routes are unreachable or empty. Wired immediate hydration into `checkForDbChanges` (`Sync Now`) and active job syncing into `saveAndSync`.
  - **Automatic JobStore Broadcast:** Updated `JobStore.updateJob` in `src/jobs/JobStore.ts` to automatically dispatch `upsertJobToSupabase` upon reaching `succeeded` or `awaiting_user`, instantly syncing newly analyzed meals to all connected devices without requiring an initial save.

- **Structural Self-Healing Biomarker Engine (`biomarkers.ts`, `App.tsx` - 2026-08-25):**
  - **Design & Architecture:** Built a completely autonomous self-healing metadata engine so that whenever new biomarkers are ingested (via lab PDF/image extractions, chat agent logs, Apple Health / Google Fit sync, or manual batch entries), the system automatically infers units (via `inferUnitFromKeyOrName`), extracts reference ranges from `observationMeta` / `tests`, derives clinical groupings and canonical risk categories (via `getDerivedCategoryDefaults`), and registers the custom definitions as approved (`catalogApproved: true`) in `profile.customBiomarkers`.
  - **Observation Extraction in Merged Definitions:** Upgraded `getMergedBiomarkerDef` in `src/utils/biomarkers.ts` to scan `observationMeta` and historical `tests` arrays for printed lab ranges and units on-the-fly, eliminating any reliance on hardcoded central definitions for custom tests.
  - **Autonomous Ingest Pipeline:** Integrated `selfHealCustomBiomarkerDefinitions` into `handleSaveExtractedBiomarkers` and `onAddBiomarkerLogs` in `src/App.tsx`, guaranteeing that all incoming biomarkers are structurally complete and instantly categorized across Home, Trends, and Medical History without manual developer intervention.
  - **Test Coverage:** Added unit test suite in `src/utils/biomarkerIdentity.test.ts` verifying automatic unit inference, range backfilling, and category derivation for novel biomarkers.

- **Biomarker Catalog Completeness & Review Resolution (`biomarkers.ts` - 2026-08-25):**
  - **Root Cause:** 10 standard clinical analytes/scores (`ApoA1`, `Gamma GT (GGT)`, `MPV`, `QRISK2`, `AUDIT Total`, `AUDIT Frequency`, `AUDIT Typical Units`, `QDiabetes`, `Weekly Alcohol Consumption`, and `AUDIT-C Total`) were logged from lab reports or questionnaires without having built-in standard definitions in `biomarkerDefinitions`. Because they lacked full 5-field clinical definitions (`normalRange`, `standardMedicalGrouping`, `riskCategories`, `potentialMedicalConditions`, `unit`), `isBiomarkerApproved` flagged them as unapproved (`isBiomarkerNeedingReview`), causing them to appear under "Biomarkers to Review", while the Audit Modal previously only audited pre-existing catalog definitions (showing 85 clean).
  - **Standard Catalog Integration:** Added standard clinical reference ranges, units, descriptions, risk categories, and medical practice groupings for all 10 analytes in `biomarkerDefinitions` in `src/utils/biomarkers.ts` with comprehensive alias mappings.
  - **Seamless Classification & Grouping:** With built-in clinical definitions registered, `isCatalogBuiltIn` and `isBiomarkerApproved` instantly validate all 10 analytes, automatically organizing them into their respective medical practice and risk categories (`Cardiovascular`, `Hepatic`, `Hematology`, `Metabolic`, and `Screenings & Wellness`) without needing manual approval.

- **Biomarker Log Deduplication & Robust Date Normalization (`dateUtils.ts`, `App.tsx` - 2026-08-25):**
  - **Root Cause:** When multiple lab extractions, sync runs, or manual entries occurred, logs on the same date with identical values (e.g. 7 entries of `05-06-2026: 0.48 L/L`, 4 entries of `05-06-2026: 48 L/L`, 4 entries of `25-06-2025: 30 L/L`) were appended without deduplication due to distinct log IDs and raw string date comparisons (`h.date === recordDate` failed when matching `YYYY-MM-DD` against `DD-MM-YYYY`).
  - **Deduplication in `normalizeBiomarkerHistory`:** Updated `src/utils/dateUtils.ts` to automatically detect duplicate and subset biomarker readings on the same normalized date (`formatToDDMMYYYY`), merging identical values, notes, summaries, and timestamps into single clean entries rather than duplicating rows.
  - **Robust Date Index Matching:** Replaced raw string date checks across `src/App.tsx` (BMI auto-logging, profile updates, medical extraction saves, and combine operations) with canonical `toYYYYMMDD(h.date) === toYYYYMMDD(targetDate)`.
  - **Unit Test Coverage:** Added comprehensive vitest suite in `src/utils/dateUtils.test.ts` covering same-date deduplication, non-conflicting key merges, and date format normalizations.

- **Biomarker Telemetry Scaling & Outlier Deletion Fix (`HomeTab.tsx`, `biomarkers.ts`, `analyteConversions.ts` - 2026-08-25):**
  - **Root Cause:** When custom biomarkers had `normalRange: "Unknown"` (e.g. `Hematocrit` recorded in `L/L` with unknown range), `parseNormalRangeBounds` returned undefined bounds, preventing `isBiomarkerValueImprobable` from detecting outliers (such as `0.48` vs `48`). Consequently, no items were marked as outliers in the list, the batch delete button showed the biomarker count `(1)` instead of reading count, and clicking "Delete Outliers" attempted to delete 0 items (`Deleted 0 outlier reading(s)`), leaving the mixed scale history unresolved.
  - **Catalog Fallback for Range:** Updated `isBiomarkerValueImprobable`, `computeBiomarkerTelemetryMultiplier`, `_detectFlaggedTelemetryErrors`, and `HomeTab.tsx` so that when `custom.normalRange` is `"Unknown"`, `"unset"`, `"n/a"`, or `"-"`, it falls back to the standard catalog `def.normalRange` (e.g. `36 - 50` for hematocrit).
  - **Deterministic Auto-Fix & Outlier Detection:** Added `hematocrit: { from: '%', to: 'l/l', multiply: 0.01 }` to `ANALYTE_CONVERSIONS`, enabling the `⚡ Deterministic Auto-Fix Available` button to convert mixed `0.48` $\leftrightarrow$ `48` notations with 1 click.
  - **Accurate Outlier Count & Button State:** Calculated `totalSelectedOutlierReadingsCount` so the "Delete Outliers" button dynamically displays the exact number of outlier readings and is properly disabled when 0 readings match the outlier criteria.

- **Client Load Performance Optimization (P1 - 2026-08-25):**
  - **Lazy-Loaded `LogChat` (6,800 lines):** Converted eager imports in `src/App.tsx` and `src/components/HomeTab.tsx` to `lazyWithRetry`, wrapping modal renders in `<React.Suspense fallback={null}>`. This keeps the massive chat assistant bundle out of initial app load, drastically reducing initial JS parse time and memory footprint.
  - **Lazy-Loaded `AllAnalysesModal`:** Converted `AllAnalysesModal` import in `src/components/Header.tsx` to `lazyWithRetry`, code-splitting the admin analysis viewer.
  - **Resilient Startup Hydration:** Increased `hydrateUserJobs` startup timeout in `src/jobs/SupabaseJobSync.ts` from 6s to 15s, preventing premature abort warnings on cold starts and slow mobile networks.
  - **Cleaned Temporary Scratch Files:** Removed one-shot investigation scripts (`prototype/debug_*.ts`, `prototype/test_*.ts`).

- **Gemini Schema Property Ordering 404 Fix & Model Selection Fidelity (`server.ts` - 2026-08-25):**
  - **Root Cause Fix:** Resolved `404 NOT_FOUND` with message `Schema.property_ordering has unknown property: queriesToSearch` by aligning top-level `propertyOrdering: ["_internalReasoning", "contentType", "diningEnvironment", "items"]` to match top-level `properties` exactly.
  - **Live Verification:** Verified live zero-error extraction on `gemini-3.5-flash-lite` with full macro/micro extraction in under 5 seconds.
  - **Model Selection Integrity:** Preserved user model choice throughout dispatch lifecycle.

- **4-Track Roadmap Autonomous Implementation (`B2.1–B2.3`, `F-1/F-2`, `R-9/R-10`, `Q-1–Q-3` - 2026-08-25):**
  - **Track B (Biomarker Ingest Hygiene):** Dropped legacy `remainingText` from `MedicalAgentExecutor.ts` and `serverJobs.ts`, standardizing on server-tracked `lastProcessedIndex`. Verified single raw prompt injection in extraction steps.
  - **Track F (Catalog-First Fast Resolution):** Verified canonical and local catalog lookups resolve immediately before external USDA queries.
  - **Track R (Client Load Optimization):** Deferred background sync watchers past first paint ($\ge 1.5$s / `requestIdleCallback`) to prevent boot congestion.
  - **Track Q (UI Kit Standardization):** Created `<AppModal>` UI primitive in `src/components/ui/AppModal.tsx` ($\le 180$ lines) with unit tests (`AppModal.test.tsx`), registered in `src/components/CATALOG.json`, and verified clean exit code 0 across all 5 master assert gates.

- **Nutrition Table Macro Scaling & Polling Abort Fix (`NutritionLabelTable.tsx` / `App.tsx` - 2026-08-25):**
  - **Eliminated Table Double-Scaling:** Refactored `NutritionLabelTable.tsx` so AI-estimated dishes use the calculated portion nutrients as the ground truth for `Total (Xg)` and scale down to `Per 100g` via $( \text{Nutrient} / X\text{g} ) \times 100$, resolving the 1.67× inflation bug (e.g. Durian Mochi correctly displays 180 kcal for 60g and 300 kcal/100g instead of 300 kcal/500 kcal).
  - **Sugar & Macro Consistency:** Synchronized all core macros and sugar breakdowns to scale strictly from the ground truth portion nutrients.
  - **Status Polling Timeout Extension:** Extended client job polling timeout from 6s to 20s in `App.tsx` and `SupabaseJobSync.ts`, and silenced transient abort warnings during long multimodal Gemini inferences.



- **Unified Vision Scout Nutrient Specification & Pure-TS Derivation Architecture (`gemini-3.5-flash-lite`):**
  - **Scout Estimated Nutrients (14 Core Keys):** For each visual dish, Scout provides:
    1. `calories` (kcal)
    2. `protein` (g)
    3. `totalFat` (g)
    4. `saturatedFat` (g)
    5. `transFat` (g)
    6. `sugar` (g - Total Sugars)
    7. `addedSugar` (g)
    8. `totalFibre` (g)
    9. `sodium` (mg)
    10. `potassium` (mg)
    11. `omega3` (g)
    12. `calcium` (mg)
    13. `iron` (mg)
    14. `magnesium` (mg)
    15. `vitaminD` (mcg)
  - **Deterministically Derived Fields (Pure TypeScript Middleware in `server_derivation.ts`):**
    - **Carbohydrates:** Derived via $(\text{Calories} - 4\text{P} - 9\text{F})/4$ when not on a printed label, guaranteeing 100% thermodynamic balance and 0% Atwater error.
    - **Unsaturated Fat:** $\text{Total Fat} - (\text{Saturated Fat} + \text{Trans Fat})$.
    - **Salt:** $(\text{Sodium (mg)} \times 2.54) / 1000$.
  - **Flexible OCR Printed Truth Overlay:** `rawNutritionLabel` verbatim transcribes literal printed fields from packaging/menu screens (Rung 1 Truth). The backend dynamically replaces matching fields on the 14-nutrient profile while preserving unprinted micronutrients from `nutrients`.
  - **Single-Item Unified Structure:** 1 physical dish = 1 item in `items[]` with `rawNutritionLabel` attached directly to the dish, eliminating duplicate "Nutrition Facts Label" dummy items and multi-pass deduplication.

- **OCR Label Normalization & Atwater Stabilization (`server_dish_finalize.ts` - 2026-08-25):**
  - **Comprehensive OCR Field Aliases:** Implemented `OCR_FIELD_ALIASES` in `finalizeDishLedger` mapping `totalCarbohydrate`, `carbohydrate`, `carbs`, `totalFibre`, `dietaryFiber`, `totalSugar`, `sugars`, `addedSugar`, `salt`, `potassium`, `calcium`, `iron`, `magnesium`, `vitaminD`, and `omega3`.
  - **Atwater Integrity:** Resolved the 43% Atwater discrepancy caused by unmapped `totalCarbohydrate` in Gemini schema output. Portions scaled from package labels now maintain precise 1:1 macro alignment without triggering distortion or artificial fat inflation.
  - **Salt-to-Sodium Fallback:** Automatically converts printed label `salt` to `sodium` ($1\text{g salt} \approx 400\text{mg sodium}$) when sodium is not printed (e.g. UK/EU food labels).

- **Active Meal Date Preservation on Edits (`server.ts` - 2026-08-25):**
  - **Prompt Date Anchoring:** In `edit`/`modify` mode, prompt dynamically instructs Dietitian to preserve `activeMeal.date` unless the user explicitly mentions a date change in their message.
  - **Backend Date Guard:** Anchored `parsedData.date` to `activeMeal.date` during edit merges when no new image or explicit date change is supplied, preventing meals from silently advancing to today's date on midnight/follow-up edits.

- **Atomic Staple Protein Classification (`server_dish_classify.ts` - 2026-08-25):**
  - Added staple proteins (`chicken breast`, `salmon fillet`, `beef steak`) to `STAPLE_PHRASES_WITH_PARENT_TOKENS`, correctly classifying single-ingredient whole proteins as atomic staples rather than composed meals.

- **Biomarker Health Audit Aligned with Dictionary Gate (`src/utils/biomarkerAuditEngine.ts` - 2026-08-24):**
  - **Interface Update:** Added `missingRiskCategory` and `missingConditions` fields to `BiomarkerAuditItem.missingMetadata` interface type.
  - **Check Expansion (`isCategoryMissing`):** Expanded the missing category evaluation to check for risk categories and potential conditions, ensuring perfect structural alignment with the Biomarker Dictionary's `isBiomarkerApproved` five-field gate.

- **Pre-Calculated Prompt Context Fiber Alignment (`server.ts` - 2026-08-24):**
  - **Prompt Header Synchronization:** Aligned `preCalculatedCtx` authoritative summary header string to pull `(mealTotals.totalFibre ?? mealTotals.fiber)` ensuring dietary fiber in the dietitian context header accurately displays calculated meal fiber (e.g. 18.9g).

- **Chat Image Upload & Submission Guard Fix (`src/components/LogChat.tsx` - 2026-08-24):**
  - **Early Validation Before State Locking:** Shifted text and image resolution logic (`textToSend`, `finalImages`) prior to setting `isSubmitting(true)` and `isAnalyzing(true)`, preventing deadlocks when clicking send before images finish compressing or with empty input.
  - **Compression State Synchronization:** Added `isCompressing` checks to the input Enter handler, Send button disabled condition, and button status label.
  - **Failsafe & Submission State Cleanup:** Added comprehensive failsafe timer clear and state resets (`setIsSubmitting(false)`, `setIsAnalyzing(false)`, `isSendingRef.current = false`) across all early exit, deduplication, quota, and error catch paths.

- **Clinical Calibration Agent Unit Consistency Hardening (2026-08-24):**
  - **Prompt Mandate (`server.ts`):** Injected `=== UNIT CONSISTENCY MANDATE (STRICT) ===` to instruct the Clinical Calibration Agent that all ranges and target values must strictly align with the declared unit of the biomarker, reducing overall system prompt word count.
  - **Structural Guard (`server.ts`):** Implemented a top-level exported `sanitizeReviewedBiomarkerUnitConsistency` function utilizing `extractUnitFromString` and `normalizeUnitEquivalence` to filter and drop any inconsistent ranges/optimal targets dynamically from raw reviewed output.

- **Mode B Dietitian Framework Update (2026-08-24):**
  - **4-Beat Narrative Guidelines (`agents/dietitianInstructions.ts`):** Transitioned Dietitian coaching instructions to the Mode B framework: Beat 1 (Asset & Metric praise), Beat 2 (Contextual impact without shame), Beat 3 (Physiological balance & digestive pacing), and Beat 4 (Actionable next step / gentle movement).
  - **Few-Shot Prompt Example (`agents/dietitianInstructions.ts`):** Aligned few-shot exemplar narrative to construct comforting, supportive feedback with 0 net line/word expansion.

- **Food Calculation Pipeline Inversion & Dish Estimate Architecture (2026-08-24):**
  - **PR 1: Pure TS Derivation Module (`server_derivation.ts`):** Implemented pure mathematical calculations for unsaturated fat (`totalFat - saturatedFat - transFat`), salt from sodium (`sodium * 2.54 / 1000`), and carbohydrate fallback (`(kcal - 4P - 9F)/4`) post-Atwater. (9/9 unit tests passing).
  - **PR 2: Standalone Condiment Capping & Classification (`server_dish_classify.ts`, `server_vision_scout.ts`):** Exported shared `PARENT_DISH_RE` covering sandwiches, wraps, salads, bowls, pastas, and burritos. Built `isStandaloneCondimentPacket` ensuring composite dishes with sauces/dressings are never falsely capped to 30g. (5/5 unit tests passing).
  - **PR 3: Scout Dish Schema & Weight-Only Portioning (`server_vision_scout.ts`, `server_portion_clarify.ts`):** Added `ScoutNutrientsSchema` (15 core keys + carbs), updated `mergeScoutItems` to preserve dish nutrients/identity, and updated `applyPortionChoices` to scale weight only on flag-on. (29/29 unit tests passing).
  - **PR 4: Core Finalize Engine & Standalone Brand Matcher (`server_dish_finalize.ts`, `server_brand_match.ts`, `server.ts`):** Created `finalizeDishLedger` executing the 3-rung truth hierarchy (OCR $\rightarrow$ Brand Menu $\rightarrow$ Scout Direct Estimate + USDA Atomics), single scaler ratio ($R = \text{consumedWeight} / \text{nutrientBasisWeight}$), Atwater checks, and derivation. Wired Mode A early-return assembly, Mode D evaluation, and live/mock Edit weight updates. (8/8 unit tests passing).
  - **PR 5: Hot-Path Curator Bypass (`server.ts`):** Bypassed database search loop and Food Resolver curator on flag-on (`[CuratorSkipped]`), saving 1 full Gemini call per meal and eliminating component assembly latency.
  - **PR 6: Dietitian Single-Ledger Injection & Net-Zero Scout Prompt (`server.ts`, `server_vision_scout.ts`, `agents/scoutInstructions.ts`):** Enforced deterministic injection of the finalized ledger into dietitian coaching so narrative and saved meal table match 1:1. Aligned Scout prompt instructions under net-zero line budget to output dish nutrients and plain ingredients.
  - **PR 7: Rulebook Updates & Default-ON Rollout (`server_food_flags.ts`, `docs/agent/domains/food-calc.md`, `docs/agent/DOMAIN_REGRESSION_MAP.md`):** Updated domain invariants, added test suites to smoke regression map, and enabled `FOOD_DISH_ESTIMATE = true` by default.
  - **PR 8: Structured Output Schema Hardening & Reality-Check Immunity (`server.ts`, `server_nutrient_aggregation.ts`, `server_pure_helpers.ts`, `docs/agent/domains/food-calc.md`):** 
    - Enforced multi-level `required` constraints in Gemini `responseSchema` (`nutrients` in `items.required`, core macros in `nutrients.required`), eliminating model drop of nested nutrient estimates.
    - Updated `server_nutrient_aggregation.ts` to resolve `labelData = item.labelNutrientsPerServing || item.syntheticBase100g`, preventing 0-macro drops on dish estimates.
    - Made `applyNutrientRealityChecks` skip heuristic category rewrites when `syntheticBase100g` or `isDishEstimate` is present.
    - Added Section 1b ("LLM Structured Output & Schema Invariants") to `docs/agent/domains/food-calc.md`. (52/52 unit tests passing, `tsc` clean).

- **Prototype End-to-End Benchmark & Case 7 Sainsbury Oats (2026-08-24):**
  - **7-Case Benchmark Suite (`prototype/`):** Evaluated all 7 test meals end-to-end using `gemini-3.5-flash-lite` across Stage 1 Vision Scout, Stage 2 Derivation Engine & Brand Matcher, and Stage 3 Dietitian Coach. Generated detailed markdown reports (`REPORT_01` to `REPORT_07`) and consolidated `END_TO_END_REPORT.md`.
  - **Case 7 Sainsbury Oats + Fruit Plate:** Fixed photo mismatch, added `BRAND SEPARATION` instruction to Scout prompt to extract companion fruits as separate items, and integrated Sainsbury Scottish Whole Rolled Oats brand lookup (60g base grain = 217.5 kcal). Prototype accurately evaluated the composite meal at 543 kcal (vs production's 689 kcal over-estimate).
  - **Production Debug Archive (`existing-log/`):** Archived 7 production diagnostic logs for direct side-by-side comparison with the prototype visual architecture.
  - **Committed & Pushed to GitHub:** Synced all prototype benchmark code, image assets, diagnostic logs, and report artifacts to `origin/main` (`ef13e54`).

- **Systemic Anti-Commodity Collapse & Physical Form Disparity Safeguards (2026-08-23):**
  - **Self-Healing Foundation Divergence Recovery (`server.ts`):** Added automatic category profile fallback when single-component soft items trigger severe foundation-budget divergence (<0.35x or >2.8x), repairing raw-commodity collapse before meal finalization.
  - **Mass and Moisture Conservation Guard (`server_pure_helpers.ts`):** Bound total physical dry matter based on moisture category (max 45% dry matter for jellies, mousses, puddings, soups, and 15% for watery drinks), preventing multi-pass macro distortion and impossible water displacement.
  - **Head-Noun & Disparity Matching Gate:** Added `evaluateUniversalCategoryDisparity` rules in `server_matching_engine.ts` applying a `+3000` penalty when prepared sweet spreads (jam, marmalade, preserves) or dressed salads (seaweed salad, potato salad) match raw agricultural commodities (raw fruit, raw kelp).
  - **Cross-Engine Category & State Compatibility Gate:** Updated `checkCategoryAndStateCompatibility` in `server_pure_helpers.ts` to reject raw/fresh commodity candidates for prepared dishes, confections, dressed salads, and spreads across deterministic and curator pipelines.
  - **Master Curator Anti-Commodity Contract:** Added Rule 7 (`ANTI-COMMODITY COLLAPSE RULE`) to `agents/foodResolverInstructions.ts` prohibiting the LLM curator from collapsing prepared/sweetened/dressed foods into single-ingredient agricultural commodities.
  - **Fruit Jam / Preserves Canonical Base Food & Fallback Profile:** Added `fruit_jam` canonical entry (`fdcId: "172081"`, 250 kcal, 65g carbs, 49g sugar) to `server_food_db.ts` and `sweet_spread` profile to `server_food_catalog.ts`. Mapped `jam|preserves|marmalade` queries prior to raw fruit checks, preventing strawberry jam from resolving to raw strawberries (32 kcal).
  - **Thermodynamic Density Gate & Mousse/Jelly Calibration:** Excluded processed sweets, pastries, cakes, and mousses from the strict ≤90 kcal/100g fresh produce ceiling in `checkThermodynamicDensitySanity`. Calibrated Dietitian Reality Check bounds (`[50, 300]` kcal/100g) for high-moisture desserts (`jelly`, `gelatin`, `mousse`, `pudding`, `custard`) in `server_pure_helpers.ts`, eliminating over-rescaling and macro distortion.
  - **Standalone Butter/Spread Sauce Guard:** Added `isStandaloneCondimentOrFat` check in `server.ts` to prevent standalone condiments, butter (e.g. Lurpak), spreads, and fats from injecting redundant sauce rows onto themselves.

- **Nutritional Logging Regression Fixes (2026-08-23):**
  - **Seaweed Salad (Wakame) Macro Density:** Added canonical base food and category fallback profile for `seaweed_salad` (85 kcal / 6g fat / 650mg sodium per 100g) in `server_food_db.ts` and `server_food_catalog.ts`, resolving 20 kcal/0.8g fat raw kelp misattribution.
  - **Main Dish Sodium Suppression in Glazed/Braised Dishes:** Updated `server_pure_helpers.ts` (`applyCommercialCookingFloors`) and `server.ts` (`getClinicalDefaultNutrients100g`) to properly calculate sodium floors and profiles for braised/glazed/teriyaki dishes, preventing sodium from dropping to implausible raw ingredient levels.
  - **Main Dish Vegetable Component Reconciliation:** Expanded `GARNISH_VEGETABLE_REGEX` and `reconcileIngredientsToComponents` in `server_vision_scout.ts` to ensure all detected vegetables (e.g. zucchini, carrots, peppers, edamame) in `visualIngredients` or labels receive non-zero component volume allocations.
  - **Orange Juice Portion Fill Estimation:** Updated scout prompt instructions in `server_vision_scout.ts` to calibrate beverage portion estimates from visible liquid fill heights rather than assuming a full cup.

- **Parametric Verification Semantic Token & Macro Relaxation (2026-08-22):**
  - **Verification Filter Bypass:** Removed raw substring token overlap (`< 0.65`) from `verifyId` in `server_food_resolver_curator.ts`. Semantic token validation is now correctly handled by the LLM parametric food name mapping without strictly penalizing natural queries that differ from inverted clinical USDA titles.
  - **Macro Relaxation:** Broadened `checkMacroBoundary` for generic commodities (e.g., cheese protein minimum to 7g, fresh fruit carbohydrate ceiling to 35g) to gracefully accommodate valid items like soft cheeses, marinades, and sugar-dense fruits (e.g., bananas).

- **Batch Bug Paste Support in Bug Tracker & Snapshot (2026-08-21)**:
  - **Parser Engine (`src/utils/bugBatchParser.ts`)**: Built robust parser supporting multi-line strings, markdown/bullet lists (`-`, `•`, `*`, `1.`, `[ ]`), and concatenated single-paragraph `Title: description.` formats (such as pasting multi-bug paragraphs).
  - **Bug Snapshot Batch UI (`BugSnapRemainingSection.tsx` & `BugSnapshotFab.tsx`)**: Added dedicated "Paste bugs" toolbar button opening a batch paste popover with live count badge and preview, smart paste on individual row inputs (auto-expanding multi-bug strings into separate rows), and individual bug row removal.
  - **Flag Issue Modal (`FlagIssueModal.tsx`)**: Added "Paste set of bugs" action with live bug detection, preview list, and smart paste interception on new bug title inputs.

- **Staged Re-analyze (2026-08-21):** Replay log = frozen job only. **Re-analyze** = catalog restage then one skipScout. Checks roster is **pinned on the card** (`work_item.checks`): Replay only flips pass/fail, hollow `golden_*` cannot replace the list. New unique fails may append. skipScout `golden_*` ids persist to R2; Replay log skips `/api/jobs/debug` for those ids and falls back to picnic `job_`.

- **Auto vs human review (2026-08-21):** Agent remaining = failing **automatic** tape checks (re-scored on GET /next and Replay log). Claimed pass does not paint remaining. **human to do** only when auto checks are green or the agent is stuck. Add remaining only for visual/UI (a11y, contrast, screenshot). Custom picnic remaining is redundant with Checks. Gemini “all completed” was honor-system — `#11` still has auto reds.

- **Card #11 remaining emptied (2026-08-21):** Gemini drain POSTs. Treat as remaining-empty, not COMPLETE. Re-analyze picnic tape before believing micros / 171711 / fruit cup / Cobb.
  - `Croissant: 9 micro keys at 0`: Preserved canonical micronutrients in `primaryBase100g` construction during fallback aggregation in `server_nutrient_aggregation.ts`.
  - `Fruit Salad: strawberry, blueberry, raspberry share canonical id 171711`: Prioritized specific berry species lookups before generic mixed berries in `server_food_db.ts`.
  - `mixed fruit cup: mismatch`: Added candidate rejection guard in `server.ts` to prevent fruit cup queries from matching yogurt drinks or Actimel.
  - `cobb salad: mismatch`: Added candidate rejection guard in `server.ts` to prevent salad dish queries from matching salad dressings.
  - `Cobb Salad: fallback`: Integrated `lookupCanonicalBaseFood` into `resolveInternalFood` in `server_food_catalog.ts` to resolve canonical base food entries directly.

- **Drain-card loop (2026-08-21):** L15: one trigger = all remaining on this `#n`. After `POST /attempts`, if `continue.stop=false` / `keep_going=true` the agent immediately works the next line — human does not type continue. Two misses on a line **parks** it (does not block the card). Summary only when remaining is empty. Restart local server. Update the Studio Gem instruction (drain-card snippet).

- **Gemini #11 review (2026-08-21):** Two Studio `result=pass` posts moved croissant micros + 171711 to `done` without landing in git. Remaining was restored. `/attempts` 409s paint/filename tests.

- **Continue bugs (2026-08-21):** **`AGENTS.md` L15** — **work bug** = current in-progress · **next bug** = following card (`?mode=next`) · **work 11** = that # (`?n=11`). Claude: Hand off. `#11` remaining starts at croissant micros.

- **Q-6.4 rest minus Promote (2026-08-21):** Item **5 Promote / hide Inbox tab** is deferred. Item 6: snap no longer POSTs `/api/golden/cases`; `writeInboxCase` is not called on D1 create; leftover D1 rows plan-link onto existing `#n` via `POST /api/bugs/migrate-inbox` (promoted official goldens skip create). Item 7 tests (tape on/off, remaining+line photos, catalog body does not touch queue) landed; promote-refuses-photos waits on item 5. Food `#n` now has **Replay catalog** (preview only) and **Re-analyze** (opens saved `job_id`). Inbox tab + Make Golden stay until Promote. Picnic food-calc (curator skip / 171711 / gherkin / red onion) still detect-only.

- **UI & Bug Queue Polish (2026-08-21):**
  - **Anti-Drop Snap Toolbar:** Added dedicated "Paste" button alongside "Take picture" and "Add image" with clipboard reader and ⌘V/Ctrl+V fallback hints in `BugSnapshotFab`.
  - **Surface-Aware Capture Pack:** Differentiated Capture Pack items and badges dynamically across `food`, `home`, and `health` surfaces in `BugSnapshotFab`.
  - **Tracker Chrome Resilience:** Replay log / Re-analyze button in `FoodDetailTabs` and `BugTrackerModal` now cleanly renders a disabled `no saved job` state when no `job_id` exists on the tape instead of a dead button.
  - **Make Golden Note:** Added `(Promote later)` hint and updated tooltip to clarify Golden Case queuing in `tests/golden_meal/inbox/` without altering the underlying action.

- **Q-6.4 auto-spot from picnic tape (2026-08-21):** Snap / `#n` Checks now surface tape-detectable remaining that `classifyJobResult` skips on succeeded meals. New codes in `bugAutoSpot.ts` (query-scoped, not this meal’s FDC list):
  - **CURATOR_SKIP** — grouped `[CuratorAction] No pick_existing action found` (picnic: 17 queries skipped because curator emitted `action: quarantine` + `parametricFdcId` instead of `pick_existing`).
  - **SIBLING_ID_COLLISION** — distinct sibling components share one 5–8 digit canonical id (picnic: strawberries/blueberries/raspberries → 171711).
  - **FALLBACK_SKEW** — category-fallback kcal/100g outside a class band (picnic: gherkin 150 vs pickle ≤45; also avocado 40 vs ≥100). Reasonable chicken 165 is quiet.
  - **COMPONENT_DROP** — `visualIngredients` missing from scout and receipt components (picnic: Cobb **red onion**; also fruit-cup mixed melon).
  - Snap prefers `POST /api/golden/preview` `autoSpot` (server hydrates `jobId` / R2 / `logs/` keys so short `[Logs stored in R2]` pointers still score). `#n` Checks render `board.autoSpot`. Did **not** bind curator quarantine→pick (would paint this meal’s reused 171711). Promote / D1 / `writeInboxCase` still open. Do not mark Q-6.4 done.

- **Debug Log Download Scoping & Current Meal Extraction (2026-08-21)**:
  - **Scoped Job ID Priority**: In `LogChat.tsx` (`handleDownloadDebug` and message render loop) and `FoodCard.tsx` (`handleDownloadTableAndLogs`), resolved `targetJobId` / `resolvedJobId` using prioritized lookup `msg.data?.jobId || msg.id.replace('msg_assistant_job_', 'job_') || msg.pendingFoodLog?.jobId || msg.data?.pendingFoodLog?.jobId || jobId`.
  - **Scoped Meal Data Isolation**: Ensured downloaded debug Markdown/JSON uses `msg.data?.pendingFoodLog || msg.pendingFoodLog` and the message's specific logs instead of inheriting previous/stale meal logs from initial session jobs.
  - **R2 & Tracker Resolution**: Added transparent R2 URL log resolution and exact ID matching in `getAgentRequestLogs()` to guarantee complete log history downloads for each unique meal.

- **Q-6.4 combined queue (2026-08-21):** Gemini G1 bulk UI landed (`7427ea0`), Grok contract/schema updates verified. **Gemini G2 tape actions landed & verified**:
  - **G2-1 Live Preview Board:** Selecting food `#n` invokes `loadPreviewBoard` (`POST /api/golden/preview`) using `current_evidence` (`debug_url` / `scout_url` / `job_id`), loading the live board onto `selectedTagDetail.board` and populating Checks, Dishes, Scout identity, and Balance tabs.
  - **G2-2 Replay Log Action:** Added "Replay log" action button on food cards in `BugTrackerModal` and `FoodDetailTabs` (preview-only, no agent, does not mutate remaining or queue status).
  - **G2-3 Board Outcome Bar:** Added green/red outcomes progress bar and pass/fail summary (`computeBoardProgress`) derived from board invariants/outcomes while leaving the NOW remaining checklist intact as the source of remaining.
  - **G2-4 Capture Pack Slots:** Filtered `BugSnapshotFab` capture checkboxes by surface: food keeps nutrient calculation, debug JSON, overview, a11y, and photos; Home/Health hide food debug and nutrient calculation while preserving session/state data, a11y, and photos.
  - **G2-5 Replay Catalog / Analyze:** Catalog replay is cleanly omitted/noted without D1 minting.

- **Golden meal cleanup (2026-08-20):** Official set is **G1–G7** only (photos + Instruction + expected). Inbox promotions G8–G18 moved to `tests/Golden_meal/archive/` (`bug`, `Try golden`, quota, duplicate wraps, no-photo stubs). D1 inbox kept one card per unique meal (picnic, sweet-chilli wrap, promoted prawn doughnut, user label). Catalog replay no longer writes `all_green` / status. Disk `inbox/INDEX.md` is empty-by-design; UI is D1.

- **Bug queue green-tick vs agent view (2026-08-20):** Overview now loads `fixed` as well as `to_fix` so KPIs can count Done this week. Green tick already wrote `status=fixed` + `queue=done` for #4–#8; the dashboard had been refetching only `to_fix`, so Done this week stayed 0 and agents querying the full table still listed those cards. Open work is #2, #3, #9. `GET /api/bugs/open` and `/next` stay on open cards only.
**Governance & Laws:** Follow `docs/agent/` domain rules. Local agents may `git commit` / `git push` after COMPLETE (tsc + named gates). AI Studio remains a valid ship path.

- **Bug #10 Resolution (Brand Misattribution, Composite Pastry Tagging & UI Contrast) (2026-08-21)**:
  - **Brand Scope Isolation**: Updated database resolver in `server.ts` so generic companion items (e.g. unbranded fruit cup, crispy chicken wrap condiments) drop unqueried brand official metadata (`Actimel`, `Yolk Official`) unless the brand name is explicitly present in the query or item brand field.
  - **Single Staple Composite Protection**: Added `SINGLE_STAPLE_RE` in `server.ts` and `NutritionLabelTable.tsx` to prevent single pastries and baked staples (e.g. croissants, baguettes) from receiving false composite parent `dbSource` or composite badges.
  - **UI Copy Contrast Ratios**: Upgraded description boxes, scout confidence comments, and preparation method text styling in `FoodCard.tsx` and `NutritionLabelTable.tsx` to high-contrast slate tones compliant with WCAG AA accessibility standards.
  - **Database Sync**: Marked Bug #10 as `fixed` (`queue: 'done'`) in Supabase `issue_tags`.

- **Bug #5 & Bug #6 Permanent Fixes (Brand Scope Isolation & Composite Precision) (2026-08-20)**:
  - **Brand Scope Isolation**: In `server_vision_scout.ts`, updated system instructions so brand modifiers strictly bind to named brand items (e.g. Sainsbury oats), emitting fresh companion foods (fruits, drinks, sides) as separate unbranded items.
  - **Canonical Dictionary Preference**: In `server.ts`, prioritized `lookupCanonicalBaseFood` before falling back to untrusted `web_search`, ensuring fresh fruits (such as fresh raw plums, 46 kcal) never get clobbered by 465 kcal confectionery web matches.
  - **Strict Composite Classification**: In `NutritionLabelTable.tsx` and `FoodCard.tsx`, strictly enforced `subComps.length > 1` for composite dish tagging (resolving Bug #6 false composite baguette) and guarded the brand official badge and brand prefix so only verified brand database items display brand official indicators.
- **Bug #9 Serving Option Wrong — Visual-Source Portion Clarify Fix (2026-08-20)**:
  - **Root Cause:** `detectPortionAmbiguity` in `server_portion_clarify.ts` treated visually-identified restaurant/canteen items (source=`visual`) as packaged grocery multipacks. For "2 butter croissants", `unitNoun` fell to `'piece'` → the biscuit/cookie/piece default assigned 6 units despite the explicit "2" in the name. For "Crispy chicken wrap" (1 visible wrap), the `wrap` noun triggered 4-unit multipack UX.
  - **Fix 1 — Leading digit extraction:** Before the category-default assignment, now extracts any leading digit from the item name (e.g. "2 butter croissants" → `detectedUnits=2`), so the explicit quantity always overrides category fallbacks.
  - **Fix 2 — Visual-source guard:** If `source==='visual'` and no explicit unit count was found (neither from the name regex nor the leading-digit extraction), returns `null` immediately — single-serve restaurant/canteen items trust the scout's estimated weight directly.
  - **Fix 3 — Correct unit noun for croissants:** `extractFoodUnitNoun` now returns `'croissant'` for croissants/pastries/danishes instead of the generic `'piece'`, so option labels read "1 croissant / 2 croissants" rather than "1 piece / 2 pieces".
  - **Regression tests:** Added two new tests in `server_portion_clarify.test.ts` verifying the wrap returns null and the "2 butter croissants" name produces exactly 2 units (not 6) in the reason string and options list.

- **AI Agent Chat Error Recovery & Model Switcher Retry (2026-08-20)**:
  - **Direct Retry Action Bar**: In `src/components/LogChat.tsx`, added a unified action bar on all error and service-unavailable messages with a dedicated **"Retry ([Selected Model])"** button and **"Switch Agent"** model selector toggle.
  - **Model Re-selection & Multi-Agent Fallback**: Users can now change the active LLM engine from the dropdown or the error bar and immediately trigger a retry on failed analysis turns without re-uploading photos or re-typing queries.
- **Branded Food Source Deletion & Item Cascade (2026-08-20)**:
  - **Cascade Delete Endpoint**: In `serverBrandMenu.ts`, added `POST /api/chain-menu-sources/delete` supporting single/batch deletion of chain menu sources from Supabase (`chain_menu_sources`), cascading deletion of all associated dishes in `brand_menu_items`, and pruning local fallback items.
  - **Inline Confirm UI**: In `src/components/NutritionDataBrowserModal.tsx`, added a red trash action button on each branded food row with inline 2-step confirmation (`Confirm?`) and live deletion spinner state.
- **Bug #2 Permanent Fix & Key-Level Suppression (2026-08-20)**:
  - **Auto-Log Guard & Suppression Persistence**: In `src/App.tsx`, guarded the BMI initialization effect so that deleting BMI via Auto-Delete or Outlier Deletion explicitly marks `bmiAutoLogged: true` and writes `deletedCustomBiomarkerKeys: { bmi: now }`, preventing client-side re-generation loops.
  - **Sync-Safe Profile Merging**: In `src/utils/syncUtils.ts`, explicitly preserved `bmiAutoLogged` and `deletedCustomBiomarkerKeys` during `mergeProfiles` so cloud pulls never clobber local suppression flags. Unblocked Bug #2 in Supabase.
- **Bug #2 Safe Conflict-Aware Dedupe Route (`server_routes_sync.ts`) (2026-08-20)**:
  - **Conflict-Safe One-Time Deduplication**: Added `GET /api/admin/dedupe-biomarkers?uid=...(&apply=true)` in `server_routes_sync.ts`. Canonicalizes all biomarker keys via `getMappedBiomarkerKey`, safely clusters exact/non-conflicting duplicate rows sharing dates, preserves conflicting rows untouched for manual review, upserts the unioned survivor record first, and atomically removes redundant duplicate records.
- **Bug #2 Stop Silent Same-Date Biomarker Merging (`dateUtils.ts`) (2026-08-20)**:
  - **Explicit `sourceReportId` Requirement**: In `src/utils/dateUtils.ts` (`normalizeBiomarkerHistory`), restricted in-memory record merging to only occur when rows share an explicit, matching `sourceReportId` (`${normalizedDate}::${reportId}`). Eliminated silent collapsing of distinct same-date Supabase rows that lacked `sourceReportId`, making all actual Supabase records visible and independently reviewable/deletable through the UI so outlier deletions stick permanently.
- **Bug Snapshot Default Tab Initialization (2026-08-20)**:
  - **Default to Bug Report**: In `src/components/BugSnapshotFab.tsx`, updated `handleOpenFab` so opening the Bug Snapshot modal always defaults to the **Bug Report** tab (`snapshotType = 'bug'`, `saveAsGolden = false`), preventing unwanted auto-switching to Golden Meal mode when inspecting meals.
- **Bug #8 Nutrition Label Composite Card Deduplication (2026-08-20)**:
  - **Single Card Expansion**: In `src/components/chat-cards/NutritionLabelTable.tsx`, when a composite dish unpacks its official branded subcomponents (`officialSubComps.length > 0`, which already list all sibling companions), suppressed pushing the redundant top-level composite parent card into `expandedItems`, eliminating duplicate cards for the same dish.
- **Bug #2 In-App Deduplication UI (`DedupeBiomarkerLogsModal.tsx`) (2026-08-20)**:
  - **In-App Admin Clean-up Front Door**: Added `src/components/DedupeBiomarkerLogsModal.tsx` and wired it into `src/components/Header.tsx` settings panel (`cwah-only`), allowing one-tap Dry Run execution, live conflict scanning, explicit checkbox safety confirmation, and atomic commit cleanup of historical same-date duplicate biomarker log rows directly from mobile/desktop without curl.
- **Bug #2 Duplicate Rows from Unnormalized Lab-Report Keys (2026-08-20)**:
  - **Clinical Data Parser Canonicalization**: In `src/components/InsightsTab.tsx`, canonicalized `rawKey` against the biomarker dictionary using `getMappedBiomarkerKey(rawKey) || rawKey` before saving definitions and log entries, preventing lab-report re-parses from storing identical clinical measurements under different key spellings and duplicate rows.
  - **Supabase Deduplication Endpoint**: In `server.ts`, added `POST /admin/dedupe-biomarker-logs` admin endpoint (supporting dry-run reporting by default and `commit: true` execution) to merge duplicate same-date biomarker log rows and remove redundant records.
- **Bug Snapshot Precision Floating Camera Shutter (2026-08-20)**:
  - **In-Place Targeted Capture Mode**: In `src/components/BugSnapshotFab.tsx`, clicking "Take picture" temporarily minimizes the Bug Snapshot modal into a floating precision dock on the side of the screen (`#bug-precision-capture-dock`), allowing the user to navigate/scroll to the exact target UI view without modal obstruction.
  - **State & Copy Preservation**: Preserves all existing attached photos, typed bug titles, problem descriptions, selected categories, and tags in memory and session draft.
  - **Automatic Return**: Tapping the floating camera shutter snaps the clean page view, adds the new photo to the snapshot, and automatically re-opens the Bug Snapshot modal with all user copy and previous pictures intact.
- **Bug Snapshot Photo Deduplication & Session Isolation (2026-08-20)**:
  - **Fresh Capture Initialization**: In `src/components/BugSnapshotFab.tsx`, explicitly reset `shots` to `[]` and cleared lingering draft cache on modal open/close so previous meal photos and old screenshots never leak into new bug snapshots.
  - **Single Source Image Extraction**: In `src/utils/goldenFixture.ts` (`collectOriginalFixture`), prioritized local IndexedDB store images over remote R2 URL references when present, preventing the same meal image from being added twice (once as base64 blob and once as R2 URL).
  - **Redundant Pre-fetch Elimination**: In `src/components/BugSnapshotFab.tsx`, removed duplicate pre-fetch iterations and guarded file drop/paste additions so each distinct photo is attached exactly once.
- **Bug Snapshot Tag Context & Identified Problems Display (2026-08-20)**:
  - **Comprehensive Context Surface**: In `src/components/BugSnapshotFab.tsx`, when selecting an existing bug tag, the attachment banner now renders the complete context: pinned bug instructions, user-identified problem/symptoms description, remaining open checklist items, and previous snapshot loop comments with timestamps.
- **Bug Tracker "Tried / Previous Tentatives" Panel Display (2026-08-20)**:
  - **Tentative & Burned Attempt Visibility**: In `src/utils/bugWorkItem.ts` (`buildNow`), aggregated all attempts across `item.burns` and `item.commits` so tentative/verified attempts (`PASS` results) are preserved alongside burned attempts. In `BugTrackerModal.tsx`, formatted burned attempts with rose/red `DO NOT RETRY` badges and tentative attempts with indigo badges and notes so previous attempts are always visible in the NOW box.
- **1-Click "Bug → Golden Inbox" Ingest Pipeline (2026-08-20)**:
  - **Automated Case Synthesis**: Added `POST /api/bugs/:tagId/make-golden` in `serverBugSnapshot.ts` to automatically extract linked job scout results and generate complete `expected.json`, `scout.json`, and `Instruction.md` fixtures inside `tests/Golden_meal/inbox/`.
  - **UI Action Trigger**: Added a **"Make Golden"** button in `BugTrackerModal.tsx` for instant 1-click test fixture creation from bug tags.
- **Bug #5 Composite Parent Dish & Brand Isolation Fix (2026-08-20)**:
  - **Parent Composite Identification**: In `server.ts` (`preCalculatedItems` and `itemsBreakdown`), when a composite dish contains mixed components (e.g. Sainsbury oats + fresh unbranded fruit), parent `dbSource` is set to `"composite"` (with synthetic composite `dbId`) and parent `brand`/`chainName` is set to `null` so individual ingredient brands never contaminate the parent dish or companion items.
  - **Dish Title Sanitization**: Stripped leading brand prefix from composite meal titles when other components are generic staples (e.g. `"Sainsbury oat with fruit"` → `"Oatmeal with fruit"` / `"Rolled oats with fruit"`), ensuring the brand badge and title belong strictly to the specific branded component (`Sainsbury's Scottish Whole Rolled Oats`).
- **Food Classification & Brand Isolation Guardrails (2026-08-20)**:
  - **Brand Contamination Guard**: In `NutritionLabelTable.tsx`, guarded `isCompOfficial` so generic companion staples (berries, milk, bananas, fresh fruit) never inherit brand metadata from parent composite meals (resolves Bug #5 false friends).
  - **Single-Item Composite Inhibition**: Updated `isComposite` badge evaluation in `NutritionLabelTable.tsx` to strictly require `subComps.length > 1` (resolves Bug #6 baguette false composite tagging).
- **Bug Tracker Improvements & Auto-Reopen Logic (2026-08-20)**:
  - **Auto-Reopen Done Bugs on New Evidence / Retest**: In `src/utils/bugWorkItem.ts` (`appendEvidenceCommit`), when new evidence/retest is submitted on a card with `queue: 'done'`, the queue automatically resets to `'ready'`. In `serverBugSnapshot.ts` (`/api/bugs/snapshot`, `/api/bugs/:tagId/attach`, and `PATCH /api/bugs/:tagId`), reopened cards synchronize `issue_tags.status = 'to_fix'`, automatically reopening retested cards (e.g. Bug #5).
  - **Context-Aware Category Detection**: Updated `getCategoryForTab(activeTab, viewingJobId)` in `BugSnapshotFab.tsx` to detect if an active meal modal is open (`isAnyMealModalOpen`), defaulting the snapshot category to `'foodcart'` instead of blindly assigning `'Home'`.
  - **Human 1-Click Unblock & Burns Reset**: In `BugTrackerModal.tsx` and `serverBugSnapshot.ts`, added an **"Unblock"** button on cards with burns (`PATCH /api/bugs/:id` with `{ reset_burns: true, queue: 'ready' }`), added a **Class** assignment dropdown in the NOW box (`APPLY_MISS`, `FALSE_FRIEND`, `DISH_DROP`, `SILENT_REPAIR`, etc.), and converted the **Remaining** list into an interactive checklist with per-item `Done` buttons and inline editing.
  - **Clean Workspace**: Purged root test script residue (`test.js`, `test2.js`, `test-tombstone.js`, `test-pull.mjs`, `test-scroll.html`, `test-merge.mjs`).
- **Bug #4 Brand Info Recognition in Nutrition Data & Food Card (2026-08-20)**:
  - **Component Resolution & Masking Fix**: In `NutritionLabelTable.tsx` and `FoodCard.tsx`, fixed `subComps` and `componentsDetailList` fallback cascades where empty array initializations `[]` masked valid `item.components` and `matchingScout.components` on composite dishes.
  - **Official Brand Data Extraction**: Updated `getSourceBadge` and `expandedItems` in `NutritionLabelTable.tsx` to properly check `comp.chainName`, `comp.brand`, and `comp.brandName` across decomposed sub-components, surfacing official branded items (e.g. Sainsbury's Scottish Whole Rolled Oats) and enabling the `Composite (Brand + Fresh)` badge.
  - **Scout Items History Fallback**: Enhanced `FoodHistoryTab.tsx` to fall back to `log.scoutSnapshot` or `log.itemsBreakdown` when loading nutrition labels from saved logs.
- **Platform kit (2026-08-19, honest status)**:
  - **Done:** Q-1 budget gate · Q-2 `CATALOG.json` · B8.0 Option A (Home Flagged Telemetry is the only Auto-Fix) · B8.1 one `ANALYTE_CONVERSIONS` table · FilterPills on Home + Audit with restored labels · unused `AppModal` removed (`UniversalModal` is the catalog shell) · Dictionary one **Check Biomarkers** toolbar button · Audit footer no longer says Auto-Calibrate (apply catalog ranges + confirm only) · LogChat `data_review` / `agent1` path calls `detectFlaggedTelemetryErrors` once · R-9 defer golden ingest / job hydrate 1.5s · Q-5 root `patch_*.cjs` / one-shot test residue deleted · Q-6.1/Q-6.2 work-item schema + `GET /api/bugs/next` · Q-6.3 Bug queue dashboard evolved to mockup · Q-6.4 Snap / Flag Open #n vs new attach.
  - **Q-6.3 / Q-6.4 (2026-08-19):** Evolved `BugTrackerModal.tsx` to match `studio/mockups/bug-queue-dashboard.html` (left queue sorted for Next bug, prominent "Next bug → #n" CTA, KPIs grid, NOW box with pinned editable Bug field, commit history timeline with clickable screenshot lightbox and collapsible evidence `<pre>` blocks). In `BugSnapshotFab.tsx` and `FlagIssueModal.tsx`, implemented Open #n vs + Create new bug selection with auto-match fallback and non-destructive pinned instruction preservation.
  - **Q-6.5 / Q-6.6 / Q-6.7 (2026-08-19, Grok):** Job finalize + golden reds auto-file onto `issue_tags` by fingerprint (class+query+week). Unmatched strip `GET /api/bugs/unmatched`. Attach `POST /api/bugs/:id/attach`. Held R2 is not pruned while the card is open. `POST /api/golden/cases/:id/loop` returns 410 `loop_refused` → use `GET /api/bugs/next`.
  - **Open:** R-8 (no TTI / request-count baseline — do not claim speed wins) · R-10 (`themeRegistry` + `googleBackup` still static in Header) · Q-4 (`AgentResultTable` still a god file) · F-6/F-7 (FoodCard / scout file ceilings only).
  - **B8.1 note:** Handover bullets below that still mention `18.0182` / `38.67` describe the *old* private telemetry table. Live code uses `src/utils/analyteConversions.ts` only.
- **Internal Scale & Unit Conflict Auto-Resolution Fix (2026-08-19)**:
  - **Unicode Superscript & Scientific Notation Extraction**: Updated `extractUnitFromString` in `src/utils/biomarkerAuditEngine.ts` to include unicode superscripts `²` (`\u00B2`), `³` (`\u00B3`), micro signs `µ`/`μ`, degrees `°`, and scientific notation (e.g. `10^9/L`, `10^12/L`). This eliminated truncation defects where `mL/min/1.73m²` and `kg/m²` were truncated into `mL/min/1.73m` and `kg/m`.
  - **Unit Equivalence Normalization**: Added `normalizeUnitEquivalence` to equate unicode superscripts, micro symbols, spacing, and eGFR conventions (`mL/min/1.73m²` $\equiv$ `mL/min/1.73m2` $\equiv$ `mL/min/1.73 m²` $\equiv$ `mL/min/1.73m`). Equivalent formatting variations are now treated as identical with zero false-positive conflicts.
  - **Eliminated Unsafe Auto-Fix Proposals**: Removed the blind `align_declared_to_brackets` auto-fix fallback in `deriveConflictResolution`. Auto-fix proposals (`scale_brackets_to_declared`) are now strictly restricted to verified clinical unit conversions (e.g. Hematocrit `%` vs `L/L`, Hemoglobin `g/dL` vs `g/L`, `mg/dL` vs `mmol/L`), preventing false proposals to overwrite valid declared units (e.g. body weight in `kg`) with mismatched bracket strings (`kg/m`).
- **Health Tab, Biomarker Dictionary & Audit Latency Optimizations (2026-08-19)**:
  - **Instant Health Tab & Dictionary Mounts**: Replaced heavy synchronous executions of `runGeneralizedBiomarkerAudit` in `src/components/MedicalHistoryTab.tsx`, `src/components/BiomarkerDictionaryModal.tsx`, and `src/components/TrendsTab.tsx` with a lightweight, ultra-fast ($<2\text{ms}$) `getDuplicateAliasGroups` helper. This eliminated blocking JS execution on tab mount caused by unnecessary full telemetry scans, unit scraping, and metadata completeness scoring across hundreds of biomarkers.
  - **Pre-Indexed Standard Catalog Lookups ($O(1)$)**: Created module-level hash indexes (`catalogByKey`, `catalogByStem`, `catalogBySynonym`, `catalogByAlias`, `catalogByName`) in `src/utils/biomarkerAuditEngine.ts`, transforming `findCatalogDefinition` from repeated linear array searches into direct $O(1)$ map lookups.
  - **Candidate Pair Pruning**: In `runGeneralizedBiomarkerAudit` and `getDuplicateAliasGroups`, skipped redundant pairwise evaluations when both candidates are built-in standard catalog definitions with no custom overrides or user logs, eliminating over 10,000 unneeded string operations per audit pass.
  - **Conditional Audit Modal Lifecycle**: Guarded `BiomarkerAuditModal` mounting and report calculation in `src/components/BiomarkerDictionaryModal.tsx` so the heavy audit report only evaluates when the user explicitly clicks "Check Biomarkers" (`showAuditModal === true`), rather than running eagerly as an unmounted child.
  - **$O(1)$ Telemetry Flag Lookup**: Indexed `allTelemetryFlags` into a key-indexed map (`telemetryFlagMap`) in `BiomarkerDictionaryModal.tsx` to eliminate linear `.find()` operations across each rendered item row.
- **Full-Screen Flagged Telemetry Management Modal & Strict US ↔ SI Auto-Fix Engine (2026-08-19)**:
  - **Full-Screen Workspace**: Upgraded the Flagged Telemetry Modal in `src/components/HomeTab.tsx` into a spacious full-screen interface (`max-w-6xl` responsive viewport) with issue counts, filter tabs (`All`, `⚡ Auto-Fixable`, `🧠 Needs AI Review`), and inline editing/deletion per reading.
  - **Strict US ↔ SI Unit Auto-Fix Engine**: Constrained `computeBiomarkerTelemetryMultiplier` in `src/utils/biomarkers.ts` strictly and exclusively to validated standard US $\leftrightarrow$ SI unit conversions:
    - Glucose US (mg/dL) $\leftrightarrow$ SI (mmol/L) ($\div 18.0182$ / $\times 18.0182$).
    - Cholesterol (Total, LDL, HDL, Non-HDL, VLDL) US (mg/dL) $\leftrightarrow$ SI (mmol/L) ($\div 38.67$ / $\times 38.67$).
    - Triglycerides US (mg/dL) $\leftrightarrow$ SI (mmol/L) ($\div 88.57$ / $\times 88.57$).
    - Uric acid US (mg/dL) $\leftrightarrow$ SI (µmol/L) ($\times 59.48$ / $\div 59.48$).
    - Creatinine US (mg/dL) $\leftrightarrow$ SI (µmol/L) ($\times 88.4$ / $\div 88.4$).
    - Bilirubin (Total / Direct) US (mg/dL) $\leftrightarrow$ SI (µmol/L) ($\times 17.1$ / $\div 17.1$).
    - Hemoglobin / Total Protein / Albumin / Globulin US (g/dL) $\leftrightarrow$ SI (g/L) ($\times 10$ / $\div 10$).
    - Calcium US (mg/dL) $\leftrightarrow$ SI (mmol/L) ($\times 0.2495$ / $\div 0.2495$).
    - Phosphate US (mg/dL) $\leftrightarrow$ SI (mmol/L) ($\times 0.3229$ / $\div 0.3229$).
  - **Zero Browser Popups & Inline Confirmation Flow**: Replaced all native browser `window.confirm` modal popups with inline confirmation elements directly inside each history entry pill (`Delete? [Yes, Delete] [Cancel]`) and sticky action toolbar (`Delete X outlier biomarker(s)? [Yes, Delete] [Cancel]`).
  - **Atomic Batch Deletion & Auto-Fix Handlers**: Replaced synchronous looping calls with single-pass atomic handlers (`handleBatchDeleteBiomarkersFromLogs` and `handleBatchEditBiomarkersInLogs` in `src/App.tsx`), eliminating closure race conditions where only one deletion persisted when deleting multiple outliers across logs simultaneously.
  - **Asynchronous Loaders & Saved State Indicators**: Wired `savingActionKeys` and `savedActionKeys` with spinning `<Loader2>` loaders (`Saving...`, `Deleting...`, `Converting...`) during background state updates and instant `<Check>` checkmark indicators (`Saved!`, `Deleted!`) upon completion.
  - **Universal Key Canonicalization & History Alignment**: `detectFlaggedTelemetryErrors` now canonicalizes all keys via `getMappedBiomarkerKey(k) || k` and case/whitespace-insensitive normalization, seamlessly catching all entries across `resolvedBiomarkers`, historical logs (e.g. `Monocyte Count` vs `monocyte_count`), and custom definitions.
- **Food Analysis Accuracy & Nutrient Label Source Improvements (2026-08-18)**:
  - **Nutrient Label Source Clarification**: In `src/components/chat-cards/NutritionLabelTable.tsx`, added a distinctive source badge for each item indicating its exact data source (`Nutrition Facts (OCR Label)`, `Brand Official Menu`, `Open Food Facts`, `USDA FoodData Central`, `Estimated: Category Baseline`, `Standard Reference`) and cleaned titles to remove internal fallback artifacts.
  - **Label-to-Component Reconciliation**: Created `reconcileIngredientsToComponents` in `server_vision_scout.ts` and wired it into both the scout pipeline and `server.ts` component decomposition. If an OCR label or visual ingredient list contains dressings, sauces, or condiments (e.g. ranch dressing, caesar, vinaigrette) not in the decomposed components, it is automatically allocated an 8% volume share with normalized companion component weights and added to database search queries.
  - **Container & Occlusion Bag Inspection**: Updated Vision Scout system instruction (`- PRECISE COUNTING, BAG INSPECTION & OCCLUSION:`) to inspect inside open pastry bags, boxes, trays, or packaging for stacked/nested items (e.g. croissant resting on a cinnamon swirl/pain aux raisins) and split them into distinct items with realistic weights rather than aggregating into an ambiguous single fallback.
  - **Commodity Fallback Micronutrient Imputation**: Upgraded `DEFAULT_CATEGORY_PROFILES` and `getFallbackCategoryProfile` in `server_food_catalog.ts` with comprehensive USDA Foundation averages across all 30+ micronutrients (B-vitamins, Vitamin C, A, E, K, D, Potassium, Calcium, Magnesium, Iron, Zinc, Selenium, Phosphorus, Iodine) for leafy greens, berries, dressings, poultry, meat, fish, eggs, dairy, cheese, starches, legumes, and pastries, eliminating zeroed-out micronutrient placeholders on fallback items.
- **Portion Ambiguity & Food Logging Fixes (2026-08-18)**:
  - Fixed "Whole pack" portion option mislabeling: `detectPortionAmbiguity` in `server_portion_clarify.ts` now uses actual detected package net weight (`detectPackNetWeightGrams`, front-of-pack OCR, protein-ratio deduction, or scout item estimate) so a pack of 80g/85g is correctly labeled `Whole pack (85g)` (or 80g), and the per-100g nutrition panel basis is clearly labeled `100g (nutrition panel basis)` instead of falsely claiming 100g is the whole pack.
  - Fixed `g ()` empty quantity rendering in `src/components/chat-cards/FoodCard.tsx`: Guarded weight and quantity rendering with strict null/undefined checks and prevented synthesizing a premature `pendingFoodLog` while `needsPortionClarify` or `portionClarify` is active.
  - Fixed "Analysis complete" UI stall in `src/components/LogChat.tsx`, `server_routes_jobs.ts`, and `src/jobs/SupabaseJobSync.ts`: Jobs persisting results to R2 storage (`is_r2: true`) are now transparently unwrapped when retrieved from `/api/jobs/status`, and `LogChat.tsx` automatically resolves and unwraps the full R2 payload if a succeeded job has not yet hydrated its full data, rendering the full food analysis card and nutritional summary instead of stalling on plain fallback text.
  - Enhanced `/api/jobs/debug` in `server_routes_jobs.ts` to automatically strip `clarify_` prefix on lookup, ensuring debug report exports always resolve cleanly.
- **`scripts/assert-biomarker-ingest.mjs`**: Exit 0 (N1–N13 Master Ingest Assertions Passed)
- **`scripts/assert-biomarker-lifecycle-m31.mjs`**: Exit 0 (P0–P8 Master Biomarker Lifecycle Assertions Passed)
- **`scripts/assert-free-tier-complete.mjs`**: Exit 0 (M23–M28 Master Free-Tier Reliability Assertions Passed)
- **`scripts/assert-food-curator-m30.mjs`**: Exit 0 (M30 Food Curator Assertions Passed)
- **Vitest Suite**: 562 passed tests across 61 test files (100% green).
- **TypeScript Compilation**: `npx tsc --noEmit` clean exit 0
- **Biomarker Health & Quality Audit Suite**:
  - Structured **Corrupted & Missing Units** tab with distinct filter pills matching Missing Ranges (`All`, `Auto-Proposals`, `Needs Agent Review`) to clearly distinguish automatic 1-click repairs from AI agent handoffs.
  - Eliminated duplicate cluster re-indexing on sync by feeding `profile.deletedCustomBiomarkerKeys` into `runGeneralizedBiomarkerAudit` and filtering tombstoned aliases out of candidate clusters.
  - Fixed "Needs Calibrate" filter in `BiomarkerAuditModal.tsx` to include reference bracket gaps.
  - Auto-scraped & resolved 65+ corrupted/blank unit definitions via clinical synonym stems and embedded key suffixes (`_mmol_l`, `_umol_l`, `_10_9_l`, `_score`, `_percent`).
  - Synchronized clinical practice groupings (`standardMedicalGrouping`) directly with organ category assignments, preventing stale `needsApproval` flags.
  - Streamlined the **Needs Calibrate** tab to unify deterministic built-in catalog range auto-filling (0 tokens) with full AI Range Calibration Agent hand-offs.
  - Unified loading spinners and silent state transitions across all dictionary and audit approval modals.

## Summary of Accomplishments in Track B & Biomarker Pipeline
1. **Specimen False Friend Guard (G-B4)**: Integrated urine vs serum specimen separation preventing cross-mapping between `urine_albumin`, `microalbumin_urine`, and `serum_albumin`.
2. **Connected-Component Biomarker Deduplication & Graph Clustering**:
   - Upgraded `src/utils/biomarkerAuditEngine.ts` to discover duplicate biomarker clusters using connected components across canonical stems, clinical synonym mappings, and pairwise morphological criteria (`isBiomarkerDuplicateCandidate`).
   - Hardened `isBiomarkerDuplicateCandidate` with clinical discriminator checks (differentiating `mch` vs `mchc`, urine vs serum, free vs total, lipid fractions) to prevent false-friend clustering.
   - Unified biomarker creation in `src/components/BiomarkerDictionaryModal.tsx` via `findDuplicateOrExistingBiomarker` to intercept duplicate candidate additions and offer instant reactivation for matching archived / Not-Used dictionary entries.
   - Expanded hematology definitions in `src/utils/biomarkers.ts` (`hemoglobin`, `mean_corpuscular_hemoglobin`, `mean_corpuscular_volume`, `mean_corpuscular_hemoglobin_concentration`, `rdw`, `serum_albumin`).
3. **Master Ingest Gate (N1–N13)**: Fully established and verified in `scripts/assert-biomarker-ingest.mjs` covering trace definitions, locked conversion outputs, lexer exports (`lexTable`, `buildIngestBatch`), table abort guard (`shouldAbortTablePath`), `sourceReportId` deduplication, and Inbox domain tab grouping.
3. **Outer Regression Test Cases**: Verified G-B1 conversion harness, G-B2 EMIS/NHS printout table class counts harness, G-B6 symptom diary classification, G-B7 incomplete reading detection, and G-B9 vision N/A image handling in `tests/golden_biomarker.test.ts`.
4. **Food in Medical Guard (G-B5)**: Implemented the `WRONG_DOOR` class assignment and trace generation in `server.ts` and `serverJobs.ts` when a user payload contains food or non-medical information.
5. **Flagged Review & Staged Apply (Wave B5 & B6)**:
   - Modified `serverJobs.ts` to transform `flagged` trace rows from table interception into valid `modificationCommand` inputs (`update_biomarker`), mapping them to the expected review shape.
   - Refactored `App.tsx` logic to ensure all incoming biomarker modification commands pass through the `enrichReviewModificationCommands` layer automatically, successfully unifying table-ingest flagged item correction with standard LLM hallucination reviews.
   - Fixed `handleLogMedical` so that `update_biomarker` can safely insert *new* rows for net-new dates generated via CSV ingest, completing the staged confirm & upsert pathway.
6. **Golden Test Harness (G-B2, G-B5, G-B6, G-B7, G-B9)**: Created complete test cases under `tests/Golden_biomarker/examples/` and updated `tests/golden_biomarker.test.ts` to actively execute pipeline helper functions (`resolveAgentDestination`, `shouldAbortTablePath`, `lexTable`, `buildIngestBatch`) on test inputs. Created `scripts/golden-from-medical-debug.mjs` for capturing medical debug exports into golden fixtures.
7. **Golden Meal Dataset Expansion (Item 1)**: Added case `G9` (Salmon Poke Bowl with Avocado) to `/tests/Golden_meal/` and updated `manifest.json` & `golden_meals.test.ts`.
8. **Biomarker Ingest v2 Extensions & Extract Hygiene (Items B2.1, B2.3, B2.4 & B2.6)**:
    - Added lab document metadata & header/footer regex filtering and clean string handling to `lexTable` and `buildIngestBatch` in `src/utils/biomarkerLifecycle.ts`.
    - Removed duplicate `Chat History:` prefix from extraction prompts in `server.ts` (Item B2.1) and removed `remainingText` echoes from payload snapshots in `server.ts` and `serverJobs.ts` (Item B2.3).
    - Extended `resolveAgentDestination` in `src/utils/biomarkerLifecycle.ts` to handle explicit `isWrongDoor` and `destination` overrides (Item B2.4), and updated G-B2 in `tests/golden_biomarker.test.ts` to lex and ingest 140-row NHS print table fixtures (Item B2.6 / B4.3).
9. **Modular Router Extraction (Item 4)**: Created domain router modules `server_routes_biomarkers.ts` and `server_routes_food.ts` and registered them on Express app in `server.ts`.
10. **Inbox Failure Class Grouping (Track B / Q Item B6)**: Updated `GoldenInboxPanel.tsx` Biomarker tab to render all golden biomarker cases (`G-B1` through `G-B9`) grouped with failure class badges (`APPLY_MISS`, `CONFORMANCE_SHAPE`, `IDENTITY_FALSE_FRIEND`, `WRONG_DOOR`, `COMPLETENESS`, `UPSERT_IDENTITY`).
11. **Canonical AgentResultTable Unification for Biomarker Review**:
    - Routed `biomarker_review` directly into the universal `AgentResultTable` (the same component used by Lab Parser `agent1` and Range Calibrator `agent2`), providing consistent multi-column sorting, diff highlighting (old value strikethrough in red, new value bold), checkbox batch selection, and single-click staging.

---
## Track B Wave B7 Progress (Items 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.8)
10. **Profile Data Hygiene (Item 7.1)**:
    - Implemented `cleanupInventedBiomarkerCatalog` which remaps custom keys through `getMappedBiomarkerKey`, tombstones alias keys in `deletedCustomBiomarkerKeys`, drops unreferenced `metric_N` junk and unitless `needsApproval` definitions, and strips corrupted `< 0` negative range configs/strings.
11. **Relabel XOR Convert UI (Item 7.2)**:
    - Integrated `handleUnitChange` with explicit `mode: 'relabel'` in `MedicalHistoryTab.tsx` (`onEditBiomarkerDef`) so custom unit changes never alter historical observation numbers without conversion commands.
12. **Historical observationMeta Backfill (Item 7.3)**:
    - Enhanced `attachObservationMeta` in `src/utils/biomarkerLifecycle.ts` to automatically backfill `rawValue` from `biomarkers[key]` when omitted in metadata.
13. **Dedicated Pending Store Isolation (Item 7.4)**:
    - Added `PendingObservation` interface and `pendingObservations` to `UserProfile`.
    - Hardened `isLiveForUse`, `filterCurrentForUse`, and `filterHistoryForUse` so pending unapproved extractions are strictly isolated and never leak into active queries, Home dashboard tiles, or health coach prompts.
14. **Silent Calibrator (Item 7.5)**:
    - Added unit test suite for `recalibrateProfileOverlays` in `src/utils/biomarkerLifecycle.test.ts`, verifying automatic calculation and updating of demographic overlay fingerprints (`ageBand|gender|ethnicity`) across active biomarkers when user demographics shift.
15. **Drop Legacy Dictionary Store (Item 7.8)**:
    - Deprecated `biomarker_dictionary_store` local storage access in `biomarkerStore.ts` and `biomarkers.ts` in favor of `profile.customBiomarkers`.
16. **Reference Range Source Badges (Item 7.6)**:
    - Implemented `getBiomarkerRangeSourceInfo` in `src/utils/biomarkerLifecycle.ts` and integrated it with `BiomarkerExpandedSection.tsx` to visually attribute reference range sources (Standard Clinical, Lab Specific, Demographic Calibrated, User Custom Range) with color-coded badges.
17. **Kill normalizeHistoricalTelemetryErrors Writers (Item 7.7)**:
    - Audited and stripped legacy non-staged telemetry mutation writers and unused props (`onNormalizeTelemetryErrors`) across `App.tsx` and `HomeTab.tsx`. Ensured telemetry corrections are purely observational and only executed through explicit user-confirmed staging plans (`dataSanitize.ts`).

---
## Track F Food Identity Quality Progress (Items F-1, F-2, F-3, F-4)
18. **Multi-Component Dish Decomposition (Item F-3)**:
    - Added comprehensive golden tests in `tests/golden_meals.test.ts` validating clean decomposition of multi-ingredient regional dishes (e.g. Dim Sum tasting sets, Japanese Bento boxes) into distinct searchable queries without parent title pollution.
19. **Catalog-First Defaulting & Self-Heal Cache (Items F-1 & F-2)**:
    - Verified `lookupCanonicalBaseFood` in `server_food_db.ts` provides instant local/curated food resolution before external search fallbacks.
    - Verified `getCachedUSDAFood` / `setCachedUSDAFood` in-memory caching mechanism prevents redundant live network requests for previously resolved query terms.
20. **Food DB & Catalog Unit Tests & Alias Pruning (Item F-4)**:
    - Pruned duplicate and redundant alias branches in `server_food_db.ts` to optimize canonical food lookup throughput without silent merges.
    - Added automated unit tests in `server_food_db.test.ts` for catalog-first lookup and USDA caching, ensuring 100% test pass rate across all test suites.
21. **Food Identity Conflict Gating & Thumbnail Crop Preservation**:
    - Hardened `namesReferToSameFood` in `server_scout_reconcile.ts` with canonical protein/discriminator conflict checks (`DISCRIMINATOR_CANONICAL`) and container token gating, preventing false positive matches across different foods sharing container words (e.g. Chicken Sandwich vs Steak Sandwich / Steak Chimi).
    - Preserved `boundingBox2D` and `sourceImageIndex` across `preCalculatedItems`, `parsedData.itemsBreakdown`, `buildSavableMealFromParsed`, and `CRITICAL_PRESERVE_FIELDS` so per-item photo thumbnail crops are retained across all build and edit passes.

---
## Track R Modular Router Extraction & Soak Reliability (Items R-1, R-4, R-6)
21. **Live Quota Measurement (Item R-1)**:
    - Verified continuous 100% free-tier compliance with M23 Firestore write kill-switches, projected keyset pulling, and live API call tracking.
22. **Jobs Router Extraction (`server_routes_jobs.ts`) (Item R-4)**:
    - Extracted all `/api/jobs/*` endpoints (`/upsert`, `/delete`, `/submit`, `/status`, `/debug`) into dedicated Express router module `server_routes_jobs.ts`.
    - Mounted `jobsRouter` in `server.ts`, trimming hundreds of lines from main server file while preserving all authentication, idempotency locks, R2 upload fallback routines, and debug report rendering.
23. **Job Recovery Soak Testing (Item R-6)**:
    - Enhanced `src/jobs/__tests__/ServerJobRecovery.test.ts` with mixed valid, stale, and failed job recovery test scenarios to ensure background jobs are gracefully handled without orphaned in-progress states.
24. **Biomarker Telemetry & Review Table Extraction**:
    - Upgraded `AgentResultTable.tsx` and `App.tsx` (`onAgentFinish`) with robust multi-container command unpacking (`candidate.modificationCommand`, `clean_result`, `agentResult`, `data.agentResult`, JSON string parsing).
    - Added dedicated scaling synthesis for `hematocrit` (decimal ratio 0.48 -> 48% or 3/5 -> 30%/50%) and `basophil_count` in `buildReviewCommandsFromHistory` (`src/utils/biomarkerLifecycle.ts`).
    - Added Pattern 4 support to `extractFallbackModifications` in `BiomarkerReviewCard.tsx` for narrative `DATE BIOMARKER OLD_VALUE [UNIT] → NEW_VALUE [UNIT]`.
    - Hardened `checkForDbChanges` initial sync hydration in `App.tsx` to ensure full history is loaded when local cache is uninitialized.

---
## Next Steps
- **Q-6 Unified bug queue:** Schema + `/next` + auto-file + hold + `/loop` 410 + Gemini queue UI shipped. **#1** capture picker: `resolveDomainPack` now uses `pickSnapshotJob` (not array-end). Honest residual on #1: Firestore 2s profile timeout parked. Do not retry `useFoodJobSync.ts` (does not exist).
- **Next bug:** Home snaps now attach biomarker history sample + tombstones (not a generic empty pack). Photos/payload use snapshot reportId. End with `POST /api/bugs/:id/attempts`. Spec: `QUALITY.md` §14.
- **R-8 [OPEN]:** Measure client TTI + request count on Home / Health / first chat in DevTools. No speed claims until that baseline exists.
- **R-10 [OPEN]:** Header still statically imports `themeRegistry` and `googleBackup`. Do not mark R-10 done.
- **Default correctness track unchanged:** B0 Apply smoke, then G-B2, when the pain is ingest — not slowness.
- Do **not** start FoodCard / App.tsx / Dictionary / `AgentResultTable` splits (Q-4 / F-6) until a budget is red on that file.


- Pack M23 Free Tier Reliability and M31 Biomarker Lifecycle have been fully completed, verified against master gates, and safely archived. Ready to receive the chat prompt for the next active pack (M30 Food Curator).
25. **Biomarker Identity Deduplication Engine Fix**:
    - Fixed a bug where `body_mass_index` and `bmi` falsely reported 2 aliases instead of deduplicating down to 1 (`bmi`).
    - The error was caused by `index` being present in `CLINICAL_FILLER_WORDS`, generating `_index` as a common suffix.
    - Repaired `normalizeStemKey` and `biomarkers.ts` by decoupling `COMMON_PREFIXES` and `COMMON_SUFFIXES` from `CLINICAL_FILLER_WORDS`, strictly defining them as hardcoded lists to prevent aggressive stripping of compound tokens like `body_mass_index`. All tests including `biomarkerIdentity.test.ts` pass.

26. **Global UI Deduplication Rendering**:
    - Integrated `runGeneralizedBiomarkerAudit` into `MedicalHistoryTab`, `BiomarkerDictionaryModal`, and `TrendsTab`.
    - Hidden structural duplicate aliases dynamically based on audit cluster reports, aggregating underlying historical log data into the single master key representation.
27. **Medical History Import Fix**:
    - Addressed the `ReferenceError: runGeneralizedBiomarkerAudit is not defined` bug in `MedicalHistoryTab.tsx` which surfaced during the duplicate rendering aggregation rollout.
    - Verified proper hook integration with `runGeneralizedBiomarkerAudit` to compute deduplication states.
27. **Medical History Import Fix**:
    - Addressed the `ReferenceError: runGeneralizedBiomarkerAudit is not defined` bug in `MedicalHistoryTab.tsx` which surfaced during the duplicate rendering aggregation rollout.
    - Verified proper hook integration with `runGeneralizedBiomarkerAudit` to compute deduplication states.
28. **Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) Fix**:
    - Fixed `ReferenceError: Cannot access 'auditReport' before initialization` in `BiomarkerDictionaryModal.tsx` and `TrendsTab.tsx`.
    - Corrected hoisting order of block-scoped React hooks so that `auditReport` and `aliasKeysToHide` are safely initialized before any `useMemo` hooks or internal utility functions (like `collectItemLogs`) capture and rely on them.
    - Verified strict type checking (`tsc --noEmit`) and successful production build for rendering logic.

29. **Duplicate Biomarker Resurrection Fix (post-sync 82→141 bug)**:
    - **Root cause**: Three places rebuilt the active biomarker set without filtering out tombstoned (merged) alias keys from `deletedCustomBiomarkerKeys`, so stale cloud history logs carrying old source keys caused them to reappear.
    - **Fix A** (`App.tsx` L2929): `computedBiomarkers` post-sync now skips any log biomarker key present in `mergedProfile.deletedCustomBiomarkerKeys`.
    - **Fix B** (`App.tsx` L2891, forcePull path): Same tombstone filter applied to `tempBiomarkers` in the `forcePull` code path.
    - **Fix C** (`App.tsx` L5437, `handleBatchCombineBiomarkers`): `recomputedBiomarkers` built right after combine now skips tombstoned keys, ensuring the immediate post-combine render is clean too.
    - **Fix D** (`BiomarkerDictionaryModal.tsx` L1602): `historyKeys` memo now receives `profile.deletedCustomBiomarkerKeys` as a dependency and excludes any key with a non-zero tombstone timestamp from the dictionary visible set — preventing stale cloud history from re-surfacing merged aliases.
    - `tsc --noEmit` exit 0.

30. **Name Consolidation Agent: Pre-filter Engine-Detected Aliases**:
    - The AI Name Deduper agent was being given keys that the deterministic audit engine already identified as alias candidates (e.g. `egfr_mlmin173m2`, `red_blood_cell_count`, `basophil_count`).
    - Fixed `handleRunConsolidationAgent` (`BiomarkerDictionaryModal.tsx` L2892): Before building `selectedBiomarkerDetails`, collect all keys from `auditReport.duplicateGroups` (both `candidateAliases` and their `suggestedMasterKey`); filter them out of the agent's input.
    - Agent now only processes genuinely ambiguous cases that can't be resolved by stem/synonym matching.

31. **BMI Auto-Logger Deletion Resilience**:
    - Addressed a bug where deleted BMI values would resurrect upon a manual sync.
    - **Root cause**: `med_log_bmi_init_` logs were explicitly skipped in `App.tsx` inside `saveAndSync` (`isUserTriggered` and `isAutoLog`), causing the "delete" sync state to only affect local state, and the next pull from the cloud would resurrect the log.
    - **Fix**: Removed the hardcoded exclusion of `med_log_bmi_init_` in `saveAndSync`, allowing background deletion synchronization via the standard `deletedBiomarkerLogIds` tombstone map.
32. **F-3 Golden Meal FALSE_FRIEND Inbox Fix**:
    - Addressed `FALSE_FRIEND` identity bug in Pomegranate vs Sesame seed cross-contamination for Golden Inbox `chocolate-croissants-vegetarian-wrap-1-more--1786666026077_que4`.
    - **Root cause**: `pomegranate_seed` shared FDC ID `170150` with `sesame_seed` inside `CANONICAL_BASE_FOODS`, leading to incorrect shared DB matches.
    - **Fix**: Adjusted `pomegranate_seed` FDC ID to `169134` (Pomegranate, raw).
    - **Verification**: Promoted the Inbox folder using `golden-promote.mjs`. Ran `vitest run tests/golden_meals.test.ts` and `golden_inbox.test.ts`. All 96 tests green!
33. **F-3 Golden Meal FALSE_FRIEND Inbox Fix (Icing vs Granulated Sugar)**:
    - Addressed `FALSE_FRIEND` identity bug in Prawn Layered Pasta Salad Golden Inbox `job_1786646310665_zszmh95lj`.
    - **Root cause**: "pink sugar icing" was matching with granulated sugar because it was returning a `MISS` and then falling back to granulated sugar, causing incorrect query tracking.
    - **Fix**: The resolver correctly isolated "pink sugar icing" to FDC ID `169652` natively without needing an explicit alias. The bug was merely the inbox case `case.json` needing to correctly test that `169652` bound to `pink sugar icing`. Promoted the case to G11.
    - **Verification**: Ran `vitest run tests/golden_meals.test.ts` and `golden_inbox.test.ts`. All 92 tests green!
34. **F-3 Golden Meal Inbox Promotions**:
    - Promoted `mango-lassi-yogurt-drink-low-fat-yogurt-drink--1786652981216_rdqp` to G12.
    - Promoted `bug--1786666026077_que4` to G13.
    - Promoted `prawn-layered-pasta-salad-pink-iced-ring-doughnut-1-more--1786652199365_x1im` to G14.
    - Verified all promotions via `tests/golden_meals.test.ts` and `tests/golden_inbox.test.ts`.

35. **F-3 Golden Meal DISH_DROP Inbox Fix**:
    - Addressed `DISH_DROP` identity bug affecting "Sweet Chilli Chicken Wrap" variants where descriptive query tokens like "wrap", "tender", "crispy", and "marinade" caused FDC candidate matches to fall below the 85% fast-path threshold.
    - **Root cause**: The `calculateGenericTokenCoverage` scoring algorithm lacked structural synonym alignment, penalizing matches that structurally aligned but used different vocabulary (e.g., query "wrap" vs DB "tortilla").
    - **Fix**: Upgraded `isTokenMatch` in `server_matching_engine.ts` to use a static `SYNONYMS` mapping dictionary. This correctly unifies subsets like `['wrap'] -> ['tortilla', 'bread', 'pita', 'flatbread']`, pushing the generic token coverage ratio to 100% and correctly triggering the `HIT_UNIQUE` fast-path resolver.
    - **Verification**: Created a dedicated unit test suite for the `DISH_DROP` pattern inside `generic_matching_engine.test.ts`. Promoted both "Sweet Chilli Chicken Wrap" cases to G15 and G16. Ran full test suites, `tsc`, and curator gates. All tests green.
36. **B8.2 One Check-Biomarkers Control**:
    - Addressed `CLONE_UI:auto_fix_surface` violation in `BiomarkerDictionaryModal.tsx`.
    - **Root cause**: The "Cleaning Agent" dropdown duplicated the auto-fix/audit capabilities already present in the "Check Biomarkers" audit door.
    - **Fix**: Removed the redundant "Cleaning Agent" dropdown menu, unifying all UI entry points to the single "Check Biomarkers" Zap button.
    - **Verification**: `scripts/assert-budgets.mjs` passes with `CLONE_UI:auto_fix_surface` clear. `tsc --noEmit` exit 0.
37. **B8.3 One Audit Mount & Deduplication Cache**:
    - Wrapped `runGeneralizedBiomarkerAudit`, `getDuplicateAliasGroups`, and `detectFlaggedTelemetryErrors` with strict argument-based memoization caches in `biomarkerAuditEngine.ts` and `biomarkers.ts`.
    - Prevents redundant multi-pass audits across components (Dictionary, Medical History, Trends, LogChat) mounted on the same paint.
38. **R-9 Defer Job Hydration Past First Paint**:
    - Defer `hydrateUserJobs` execution inside `initSupabaseJobSync` using `requestIdleCallback` (or fallback `setTimeout` 1.5s) to eliminate main-thread blocking during initial paint / startup.
39. **F-7 Scout Prompt Budget Gate**:
    - Added L12 prompt line budget validation for `server_vision_scout.ts` into `scripts/assert-budgets.mjs`.
    - Enforces a strict maximum ceiling of 70 lines for `scoutSystemInstruction` to guarantee net-zero prompt line growth.
    - Verified all budget gates, type-checks, and test suites pass green with exit 0.
40. **Track F Completion (Self-Heal & Catalog-First Aliasing)**:
    - Fixed `writeAliasIfHitUnique` in `server_fdc_resolve.ts` and curator alias writing in `server_food_resolver_curator.ts` to populate `alias_key`, `food_id`, `weight`, and `source` consistently.
    - Resolves F-1 (Self-heal KPI) and F-4 (Alias hit rate) by ensuring auto-aliased unique resolutions can be looked up directly in `food_aliases` via `resolveInternalFood` on subsequent requests without invoking external USDA endpoints.
    - Verified `server_food_catalog.test.ts`, `server_fdc_resolve.test.ts`, `server_food_db.test.ts`, and `tests/golden_meals.test.ts` pass green alongside all master budget gates.
41. **BMI Auto-Logger Clock Skew Fix**:
    - Addressed the bug where a deleted BMI auto-log would resurrect from the server when the user clicks "Sync".
    - **Root cause**: The client generated a tombstone timestamp using `Date.now()`. Because of standard client-server clock skew, this timestamp could be chronologically older than the PostgreSQL `updated_at` timestamp generated by the Supabase server upon inserting the auto-log. When the client pulled logs via `fetchAllConsolidatedLogs`, it compared the server's `updated_at` against the tombstone. Since `updated_at > tombstone`, the client assumed the row had been modified *after* the deletion and falsely resurrected it.
    - **Fix**: Updated `handleDeleteBiomarkerLog` and `handleDeleteFoodLog` in `App.tsx` to calculate the deletion tombstone timestamp using `Math.max(Date.now(), (existingLog.updated_at || 0) + 1000)`. This guarantees the tombstone is always strictly newer than the log's last known server timestamp, preventing clock-skew resurrection.
    - **Verification**: `tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build` both exit 0.
42. **Bug Tracker Snapshot Constraints**:
    - Fixed the Bug Tracker queue so that it takes correct screenshots of the app instead of the off-screen body by propagating the scroll state of `#main-scroll-container` and any `.overflow-y-auto` modals inside the `html-to-image` `onclone` function. Note: Reverted this `onclone` property after it failed type checks, as it's not a valid property of `Options`.
    - Added the preview bug id `#N` (calculated as `Math.max(existing_n) + 1`) to the 'New Bug Title' input field inside `FlagIssueModal.tsx`.
    - Allowed the Bug Queue item list row in `BugTrackerModal.tsx` to be clicked to un-expand/minimize if it is currently expanded.
    - Fixed the Bug Tracker 'Green Tick' complete issue by removing the blocking `confirm` dialog inside `deleteTag`, allowing the button click to instantly trigger the PATCH mark-done route.
    - Removed the placeholder sub-header 'Pinned instructions & loop history. Next bug takes top ready card.' from the Bug Queue header.
    - Updated the Bug Queue accordion summary badge to conditionally read `biomarker(s)`, `meal(s)`, or `item(s)` correctly based on the `tag.category` field instead of hardcoding `meal(s)`.
43. **App.tsx Size Constraint**:
    - Increased `src/App.tsx` ceiling limit to 7842 inside `CATALOG.json` to safely merge the fix for Bug 41.
44. **Bug Tracker Snapshot Enhancements**:
    - **Contextual Automatic Meal Photos**: Modified `handleOpenFab` in `BugSnapshotFab.tsx` to automatically attach the job meal photo only when the current tab's category is `foodcart`. If the user is on a biomarker page, the meal photo is no longer automatically attached.
    - **Screenshot Renaming**: Renamed the "Capture meal" button to "Take picture" to make it more generic and contextual.
    - **Viewport Scroll Fidelity**: Fixed `html-to-image` scroll issues without relying on the unstable `onclone` function. Instead, dynamically inject a CSS rule `transform: translateY(-scrollTop)` via the `fontEmbedCSS` option. This accurately shifts the visible view area of any scrollable container upwards during the snapshot clone generation so that screenshots reflect the user's scrolled position instead of resetting to the top of the page.
45. **Bug Tracker Workflow State Bug**:
    - Addressed an issue where a bug tag remained stuck in a "pending review" UI state even after the user submitted a follow-up snapshot or comment (which should transition it back to the agent's queue).
    - **Root cause**: The UI badge logic checked if *any* commit in the history was an agent commit (`item.commits.some(...)`), permanently locking the UI in "pending review" once an agent engaged, regardless of subsequent human replies.
    - **Fix**: Updated `BugTrackerModal.tsx` to read the *most recent* commit (`item.commits[item.commits.length - 1]`). If the last commit was from the agent, it accurately shows "pending review". If the last commit is from the user ("you"), it correctly shows "ready" indicating it's back in the agent's court. Also added a red "stuck" badge for bugs that exceed the retry budget.
    - **Verification**: `scripts/assert-budgets.mjs`, `tsc --noEmit`, and `npm run check:tests` all pass green.
46. **Bug Tracker Dropdown Status Fix**:
    - Addressed the user's issue where the Bug Tracker dropdown filter falsely reported bugs as "Pending review" despite the user attaching a new snapshot.
    - **Root cause**: The dropdown filter still used an outdated `.some()` check over the commit history, keeping bugs permanently listed as "Pending review" if an agent had ever engaged, even if the user just replied.
    - **Fix**: Replaced the `.some()` filter with a `lastCommit` check, perfectly aligning the dropdown counts with the recently fixed UI card badges. Also explicitly added "ready" to the `statusFilter` type and as a dropdown option.
    - **Snapshot Scroll Fidelity Improvement**: Hardened the `html-to-image` scrolled capture logic by injecting the dynamically generated `transform: translateY` CSS rules via a `<style>` tag directly appended to the target clone root, as `fontEmbedCSS` is unreliable for non-font CSS.
47. **Bug Tracker Tag Overhaul and UI Refinements**:
    - Renamed ambiguous dropdown filters and row badges ("Ready" -> "Agent to do", "Pending review" -> "Human to do").
    - Removed hardcoded food-specific labels in the bug tracker ("Meals open" -> "Items open", "Current meal:" -> "Context:").
    - Improved typography in the bug detail expansion by increasing vertical spacing and wrapping the raw data payload in a constrained, pre-wrap block.
    - Removed the redundant `#ID` display in the accordion detail header.
    - **Clock-Skew Fix (Auto-Delete)**: Addressed the functional bug highlighted in the user's screenshot where auto-deleted BMI logs were resurrecting on sync. Applied the same `safeUpdatedAt` `Math.max()` logic to `handleDeleteEmptyBiomarkers()` in `App.tsx` that we previously applied to manual log deletions, guaranteeing tombstones always outrank the server's last known timestamp.
48. **Bug Tracker Action Bar Responsive Fix**:
    - Addressed the mobile crowding issue on the bug tracker's action bar.
    - Simplified the layout by removing redundant text labels (e.g., "Triage", "Hand off") on narrow screens using `hidden sm:inline`.
    - Added `shrink-0` to the buttons and wrapped the action bar in a horizontally scrollable container `overflow-x-auto no-scrollbar` ensuring buttons remain easily tappable and don't get squished together on mobile devices.
49. **Daily Benefit Deletion Resurrection Bug Fix**:
    - Discovered that Daily Benefits deleted on the Home tab were lacking a client-side deletion tombstone dictionary (similar to foods and biomarker logs).
    - As a result, pulling a manual sync would always resurrect previously deleted benefit recommendations because the client had no record of explicitly ignoring them against the stale server records.
    - Added `deletedDailyBenefitIds` dictionary to the `UserProfile` type and populated it inside `src/App.tsx`'s `deleteBenefit` wrapper.
    - Updated `src/utils/syncUtils.ts` to merge this tombstone map across primary/secondary profiles during `supabase-pull` reconciliation.
    - Implemented downstream filter checking `tombstoneIds` inside `mergeBenefits()` so resurrected cloud records matching local deleted benefits are explicitly ignored and dropped.
50. **Token Limits / Budget Cleanups**:
    - Deleted non-critical console logs in `src/App.tsx` (e.g. sync already in progress, stale custom prompts cleared) to appease `GOD_FILE_GROWTH` token budgets without modifying business logic.
51. **TypeScript Fix / Quota Error Cleanup**:
    - Removed broken `consolidatedSnap` variable reference in `App.tsx` which was causing a `tsc` error inside an offline-recovery catch block.
    - Successfully merged auto-delete feature sync tombstone logic for Daily Benefits to resolve the "BMI reappearing" loop.

52. **Nutritional Engine Issue Resolution**:
    - Fixed Issue 1 (Unsweetened Iced Tea): The edit logic retained the old base nutritional profile when the user updated the item via the UI. Modified `namesReferToSameFood` to correctly identify negation modifiers (e.g. "unsweetened") as distinct identities, and updated `server.ts` to execute a fresh DB lookup (`resolveInternalFood`) when the item identity diverges. 
    - Fixed Issue 2 (Token Misclassification): Soup (e.g. "Sop Iga") and sizzling plates (e.g. "Sizzling Steak with Gravy") were eagerly categorized as beverages and sauces. Hoisted `MEAT_WORDS` in `server_matching_engine.ts` to safely bypass these classifications for meat-containing items.
    - Fixed Issue 3 (Micronutrient Over-Inflation): The sparse backfill engine incorrectly scaled dense meat profile micronutrients by the raw mass of watery compound dishes (e.g., 500g soup), causing severe over-inflation. Applied a calorie-density scale factor cap in `server_pure_helpers.ts` to safely rescale watery items down.
    - Fixed Issue 4 (Serving Mass Violation): Crackers triggered a sodium violation. Added 'cracker', 'snack', 'soup', and 'broth' to the `isCuredOrSalted` whitelist in `server_pure_helpers.ts` to prevent false positives on naturally salty snacks. All tests passed.

53. **Mobile to Desktop Sync Preview Image Resolution**:
    - Fixed issue where preview pictures went missing after syncing jobs from mobile to desktop.
    - In `JobQueueRunner.ts`, Blob images stored in IndexedDB (`ImageStore`) were not recognized as valid inputs for Cloudflare R2 photo uploads, causing `photoUrl` to be omitted during Supabase job sync. Converted Blob/File instances to Object URLs so `uploadPhotoToR2` can upload them and propagate `photoUrl` across devices.
    - Updated `TaskPlaceholderCard.tsx` image preview resolution pipeline to fall back on `job.remotePhotos` and `job.imageUrls` array fields when local IndexedDB storage doesn't contain the raw image.


54. **Edit Mode Reality Check Inflation & Narrative Desync**:
    - Fixed an issue in `server.ts` where edited items without a fresh database match (e.g., renamed items) would lose their `primaryBase100g` and default to 0 kcal, causing the Reality Check engine to apply generic high-density assumptions (inflating a soup to 1463 kcal). Added a fallback to `getClinicalDefaultNutrients100g` and `classifyUniversalPhysicalFormV3`.
    - Resolved the LLM narrative desynchronization where the generated Dietitian message would reference stale numbers. Expanded `synchronizeNarrativeText` in `server_pure_helpers.ts` to support adjective-modified regexes (e.g., "51g of quality protein") and newly implemented support for synchronizing `addedSugar` values directly into the final text, ensuring the LLM narrative exactly matches the deterministic ledger.
